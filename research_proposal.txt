RESEARCH PROPOSAL 

The aim of our research paper is to investigate the interrelation between the price of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and commenting activity on the r/cryptocurrency forum on reddit in the time period of Nov 2017 - Mar 2018. The starting poin of our analysis are two datasets: 1) An already created dataset consisting of comment activity in the subreddit, obtained via Kaggle. 2) A dataset consisting of Coindesk's Bitcoin price index, which will be retrieved via its public API. 

During the course of the study, we want to investigate several different phenomena and research questions. The exact research questions are subject to change over the course of time, the preliminary ones so far are: 

1) Is there a correlation between higher volatility/prices and commenting activity? 
2) Do higher prices lead to more new users? 
3) Which topics are discussed in the comments? 
4) What is the sentiment of the comments and does it change over time (in relation to the price of Bitcoin? 

Furthermore, a possible extension would be to predict the number of comments in the subreddit per week as a function of previous activity and the price of bitcoin.

We believe this project will fit well within the scope of the course as it employs a lot of different techniques and methods taught in the class, such as topic modeling, (un-)supervised learning, collecting data via APIs.
