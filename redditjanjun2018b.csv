8r12k6,1528975530,Bityuan,6,0,Mr WU Sijin：Blockchain will break up the financial monopolies and financial agency will disappear |The Finance Executive Council (FINEC),"    On May 20th, the 2018 Blockchain and Internet Finance High-end Closed-door Conference was successfully held in Hangzhou. The event was jointly organized by the Finance Executive Council and the Hangzhou Canal Auto Internet Industrial Park. It was also supported by Zhejiang Big Data Technology Association and other units.
    Mr WU Sijin, the founder of Hangzhou Fuzamei Technology Limited (FUZAMEI) and blockchain expert , shared with over 100 senior executives that consumers, suppliers, and laborers can jointly build a shared economic ecology on the blockchain public chain. Conversely, joint-stock companies, financial institutions and other financial agencies will disappear on a large scale.

*Processing img 6n7ij4z0by311...*

FUZAMEI has already began to develop the blockchain research since 2013. Currently, accumulated number of patent applications exceeds 50, ranking the top 10 worldwide. Mr. Wu Sijin, founder of FUZAMEI, pointed out at the meeting that consumers, suppliers and workers can jointly build a shared economic ecology on the blockchain and the chain will help enterprises to get rid of dependence on traditional financial capital institutions. Intermediaries such as financial institutions will disappear in large numbers. Blockchain allows companies to package and segment debt note, which can be passed to use in the ecosystem and supply chain management. The corporate costs, therefore, can even be reduced by more than 50 percentage.

*Processing img kqx8zyz3by311...*

**The following is a record of Mr WU’s speech:**

It is a great privilege to discuss the blockchain with everyone. FUZAMEI was founded in Hangzhou in 2008. “FUZA”in English means Complexity while “MEI”in English means Beauty. The name was inspired by a book I read when I was a graduate student, “Complexity”. Life is a process from simple to complex. This is a law. The blockchain is very complicated, however, we have done it beautifully. We started to research the blockchain in 2013. In the early days, we made a blockchain wallet and accumulated more knowledge. In 2015, we visited the government to promote the blockchain, contributing to the blockchain boom in China. Also, the prosperity of blockchain companies in Hangzhou was in large part due to us.

Since we explored earlier, we have accumulatively applied for more than 50 patents, ranking the top 10 in terms of the number of patents worldwide. Blockchain patents in Hangzhou are absolutely the first in the world, including Alibaba and us. We also have many application scenarios and almost 10 of the world’s top 500 companies cooperate with us. One of the earliest cooperating project was the HNA Group (HaipingX). We made a blockchain commercial draft transaction system and currently have a turnover of 20 billion RMB.

    In 2014, FUZAMEI applied for the first blockchain invention patent: ‘the wallet recovery function’, which was authorized in December 2017. Currently, it has applied for more than 50 invention patents in the scope of blockchain technology, of which 2 have already authorized. Our main project direction is blockchain notes, receivables, prepayments, warehouse receipts, points, exchanges, etc. There are over 250 employees in the company, and 50 blockchain core developers. I believe that our company locates at the leading position worldwide in terms of the company scale and technology

*Processing img zlyjvnmbby311...*

The blockchain principle is actually not complicated. The public is unfamiliar blockchain. In fact, it can be understood in 3 minutes. As you can see, there are 10 digital ledgers in this picture, Tom has 30 rmb, and Sam has 50 rmb. Each account ledger is exactly the same. This is the first concept of the blockchain: multiple accounts records the transactions simultaneously, and each account ledger is the same and can be mutually verified. Of course, only if more than 50&amp;#37; of the nodes agree, can a transaction be successfully written to the blockchain. Next, I will introduce our company’s blockchain\-based application.

**Debt Note**

We have built up a commercial draft transaction system for HNA Group ([HaiPingX.com](https://www.haipingx.com/)). Now we are focusing on debt note projects. Take the example of supply chain in computer industry, the core company (e.g. Dell) purchases hard drives from supplier A and pays the money three months later. In traditional way, the supplier A has to borrow money from banks to maintain its production due to the payment delay. However, since the blockchain technology is traceable, the core company can issue a debt note to the supplier A as a credit proof. Then, this debt note can be fully circulated until the last owner redeems it with the core company. The circulation of debt note isolates the financial intermediaries from supply chain, significantly reducing costs and improving efficiency. It is convenient to use the debt note since it can be split as well. The blockchain\-based debt note will have a great impact on automobile industry. The corporations in this chain do not require money from financial intermediaries. Yes, the following assembly companies get debt note from core company to purchase parts, and manufacturers use the debt note to purchase raw materials. The auto industry can definitely do it. ([The detail on debt note](https://medium.com/@fuzameitwitter/debt-note-a-blockchain-solution-to-supply-chain-finance-e3f8b8e1c8e1))

*Processing img kcruy7phby311...*

**Supply Chain Management**

Supply chain management is also very important. In fact, we also talked with [Xiaomi](http://%28https//www.mi.com/index.html). It is prepared to spend a few years to make a good supply chain management system, especially in the automotive industry. In the automotive industry, there are many component manufacturers, increasing the difficulties to manage suppliers. If all information can be recorded in the blockchain including raw material procurement, semi\-finished product procurement and logistics, the entire supply chain system will be more transparent. If there are problems with quality and delayed delivery, it may be possible to use a blockchain smart contract for direct deductions or to eliminate unqualified suppliers.

*Processing img a87y1yrlby311...*

In the blockchain, any company engaging in counterfeit production can be traced back and will lose credit. Instead, trustworthy companies can accumulate credits in the blockchain to gain recognition of the entire supply chain, and even global recognition, which is helpful to expand business globally. The blockchain application in automotive industry can bond all small enterprise suppliers together, forming an ecosystem. Everyone involved will benefit from the economies of scale.

*Processing img g78g2exnby311...*

Due to our technology development, FUZAMEI has gained a lot of attention and recognition. In 2016, FUZAMEI won the top ten list of blockchain in China ; In September 2017, “FUZAMEI blockchain\-based supply chain financial service platform” became as the first batch of pre\-test Trusted Blockchain products by the China Information &amp; Communication Institute. Indeed, the company’s joint R&amp;D product “Media financial blockchain trading platform” has been rated as a trusted blockchain — excellent financial applications. In November 2017, “33FUZAMEI Blockchain \+ Supply Chain Financial System V1.0” passed the evaluation of China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute."

&gt;There is no ""force"", there is choice.  Each user chooses the software they run to validate the chain.  If a majority of users choose to switch to SHA-512, that is what will happen, regardless of the number of miners who switch.

Bitcoin is the same. It doesn't matter how many institutions ""support it"", or ""back it"", or ""adopt it"". What matters is user choice - If users collectively stop accepting fiat for their work, that is what will happen, Bitcoin will prevail. (But it won't invalidate fiat, hence a soft fork.)

SAN FRANCISCO — A concentrated campaign of price manipulation may have accounted for at least half of the increase in the price of Bitcoin and other big cryptocurrencies last year, according to a paper released on Wednesday by an academic with a history of spotting fraud in financial markets.

The paper by John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas, and Amin Shams, a graduate student, is likely to stoke a debate about how much of Bitcoin’s skyrocketing gain last year was caused by the covert actions of a few big players, rather than real demand from investors.

Many industry players expressed concern at the time that the prices were being pushed up at least partly by activity at Bitfinex, one of the largest and least regulated exchanges in the industry. The exchange, which is registered in the Caribbean with offices in Asia, was subpoenaed by American regulators shortly after articles about the concerns appeared in The New York Times and other publications.

Mr. Griffin looked at the flow of digital tokens going in and out of Bitfinex and identified several distinct patterns that suggest that someone or some people at the exchange successfully worked to push up prices when they sagged at other exchanges. To do that, the person or people used a secondary virtual currency, known as Tether, which was created and sold by the owners of Bitfinex, to buy up those other cryptocurrencies.

“There were obviously tremendous price increases last year, and this paper indicates that manipulation played a large part in those price increases,” Mr. Griffin said.

Bitfinex executives have denied in the past that the exchange was involved in any manipulation. The company said on Wednesday that it had never engaged in “any sort” of market or price manipulation. “Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex,” Jan Ludovicus van der Velde, Bitfinex’s chief executive, said in a statement.

The new paper helped push down the already sinking price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Wednesday. The price of Bitcoin fell as much as 5 percent after the report was published, approaching its lowest point of the year. Bitcoin is now down more than 65 percent from the highs it hit late last year.

The authors of the new 66\-page paper do not have emails or documents that prove that Bitfinex knew about or was responsible for price manipulation. The researchers relied on the millions of transaction records that are captured on the public ledgers of all virtual currency transactions, known as the blockchain, to spot patterns. This method is not conclusive, but it has helped government authorities and academics spot suspicious activity in the past.

In particular, Mr. Griffin and Mr. Shams examined the flow of Tether, a token that is supposed to be tied to the value of the dollar and that is issued exclusively by Bitfinex in large batches. They found that half of the increase in Bitcoin’s price in 2017 could be traced to the hours immediately after Tether flowed to a handful of other exchanges, generally when the price was declining.

Other large virtual currencies that can be purchased with Tether, such as Ether and Zcash, rose even more quickly than Bitcoin in those periods. The prices rose much more quickly on exchanges that accepted Tether than they did on those that did not, and the pattern ceased when Bitfinex stopped issuing new Tether this year, the authors found.

Sarah Meiklejohn, a professor at the University College London who pioneered this sort of pattern spotting, said the analysis in the new paper “seems sound” after reviewing it this week.

Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, a firm that analyses blockchain data, also said the study “seems credible.” He cautioned that a full understanding of the patterns would require more analysis.

Mr. Griffin previously wrote research pointing to fraudulent behavior in several other financial markets. He drew attention for a 2016 paper that suggested that a popular financial contract tied to the volatility in financial markets, known as the VIX, was being manipulated. A whistle\-blower later came forward to confirm those suspicions, and now several active lawsuits are focused on the allegations.

Beyond his work at the University of Texas, Mr. Griffin has a consulting firm that works on financial fraud cases, including some in the virtual currency industry.

“The relationship between Tether and the price of Bitcoin has been flagged for months within the community,” said Christian Catalini, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in blockchain research. “It is great to see academic work trying to causally assess if market manipulation is taking place.”

The new paper is not the first academic work to identify manipulation in the virtual currency markets. A paper published last year by a team of Israeli and American researchers said much of Bitcoin’s big price increase in 2013 was caused by a campaign of price manipulation at what was then the biggest exchange, Mt. Gox.

Starting a business is to stick to some bottom line, in the currency circle, at least two things need to understand clearly: the authenticity of investment celebrity platform and the rationality of the use of private funds. This is a necessary process to push the industry forward. About this thing in the currency circle of the big guys have communicated many times, most really rich really want to do things are gradually formed consensus, but Li Yu to the exception, I think I targeted him and turned into a private rumor of personal attacks. I question [Block.one](https://block.one/)'s private equity and Li Yu's scam.

Here are a few facts, and I can bear the corresponding ""burden of proof"".

1. I have communicated with Li xiaolai in private several times how to stop stealing private funds and a large proportion of free money, doing some positive energy things, be ignored;

2. Xu Xiaoping teacher and Hongbo organization ""block chain first Dinner"", we argue can not be stolen private funds and a large proportion of free currency, huff up to no consensus;

3. Li xiaolai began in June 2013 to September, raised 30,000 Bitcoin, and verbally promised that it would be guaranteed by Bitcoin, which expired last September and was requested to be postponed for a year; the next September is the time of maturity; This is the industry old people well\-known things, I did not lie;

4. Li Yu to raise the Bitcoin, into the just\-dice to gamble, one of the accounts, even created the history of Bitcoin the biggest gambler's reputation, these information high level of people can find online;

5. Li Yu exchanges Bigone, INB Capital and fund\-raising accounts are mixed with their personal accounts, and to show people their wealth, fictitious its ""richest Man"" illusion; 6. There is no concept of public money in the concept of Li Yu, the vast majority of his projects have been a large proportion of their own, and a large proportion of the free currency in the two\-tier market cast; most typical when he and OTCBTC Zheng Yiting tear force of the core reason is that Li xiaolai want to take away 40&amp;#37; of the fund\-raising and Zheng think he has no

The right to do so, funny is Li xiaolai also in micro\-Bo scold Zheng Don't speak credit!

7. I question [Block.one](https://block.one/)'s statement that private accounts for 4 billion of dollars are not responsible for anything, it is hoped that without naming the situation can promote the domestic currency of the public funds reasonable use of the consensus, the result became a Li xiaolai group of EOS personnel to attack me personally, so I had to roll the call.

8. I do not have a wallet, do not remember the bank password, although the investment of many exchanges, media, market, wallet, etc., but never let them help me on a currency;

9. Three o'clock the group of several coins, and I have no concern, I was early to help blind people, not and anyone recommended, also think that they should not be over marketing, should do a good job; three o'clock Group of any General Assembly, I did not participate in the organization, my name was stolen is the organizers of the mess; 10. I have no direct conflict of interest with Li Yu, it is a conflict of values, let me in this industry mixed to vomit;

Personally, I have no intention and no need for this hot excrement to provoke the Sao, still need not rely on him to make up for oneself; 11. My plea is clear, that is, hope that the industry bosses can form a ""no corruption"" consensus. If you do, you will never be able to!

Li xiaolai's response to some of Albert Chan's comments:

It was one of those March days, in ""The Three O'Clock Mars founders"", I really can't watch, with Chen Weixing a dialogue. Familiar with my people know, I always cherish the time, because their time is my own life. I want to be kind to myself, so I don't want to spend my time on things that are not worth it.

However, the recent Chen Weixing of all kinds of behavior and speech, let me have to waste a small part of their lives, but also helpless. It's hard not to mix emotions with such a person, such a thing, so, I write down the first title of this text is ""endure nausea seriously respond to Chen Weixing's remarks, with the fact that ... was written down and changed to the present response to some of the comments about Albert Chan, removing the emotional component\-\-at a time like this , it takes a lot of strength to stay calm. If you are not able to control your emotions as a reader, then do not read them down.

Other readers, do not care about what happened in the currency, then do not waste time\-after all, although the lively is someone else's, but life is their own. After reading Chen Weixing's remarks, the uninformed reader feels that this is all a Chen Weixing of the Evil (Li xiaolai) of the struggle for justice.

But this technique is too clumsy.

There was a joke in the previous crosstalk, 逗哏 asked 捧哏:

Are you still hitting your dad? 捧哏 Meng, this word has a trap ah! No matter the answer is not right ah! 捧哏 deeper embarrassment lies in: ""Why do you accuse me of having beaten my father?""

""Obviously this is the trap of 逗哏, but 捧哏 no fight back, because the audience which tube this ah, first own happy to say ...

Although I am not 捧哏, but Albert Chan is using this way to Li Yu to the next set.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After I have made clear the routines, I can not understand the emotional low article to refute: Starting a business is to stick to some bottom line, in the currency circle, at least two things need to understand clearly: the authenticity of investment celebrity platform and the rationality of the use of private funds. This is a necessary process to push the industry forward. About this thing in the currency circle of the big guys have communicated many times, most really rich really want to do things are gradually formed consensus, but Li Yu to the exception, I think I targeted him and turned into a private rumor of personal attacks. I question [Block.one](https://block.one/)'s private equity and Li Yu's scam.

Here are a few facts, and I can bear the corresponding ""burden of proof"". Chen Weixing to the point of labeling, ""entrepreneurship is to stick to some of the bottom line""\-so the intention is to first put the opponent to the ""no bottom line"" position, and then wave the ""Justice of the stick."" Further down, the wording is as follows: Here are a few facts, and I can bear the corresponding ""burden of proof""\-unfortunately, read\-by\-article, there is no fact, there is no evidence.

At this point, the logic of Albert Chan is not qualified, legal knowledge is near the law of illiteracy.

1. I have communicated with Li xiaolai in private several times how to stop stealing private funds and a large proportion of free money, doing some positive energy things, be ignored; Chen Weixing never personally communicated this topic to me in private. The only time we had a separate communication (the presence of his own female assistant) was Albert Chan who came to my office a few days before his birthday to preach his chain of cabs. He had no face at the time, so he was in high spirits ... After listening to him, I smoked several cigarettes.

Then, to give him face, I also went to the Chen Weixing birthday party.

But what is stated in this article of Albert Chan is not a fact, and of course there is no evidence.

2. Xu Xiaoping teacher and Hongbo organization ""block chain first Dinner"", we argue can not be stolen private funds and a large proportion of free currency, huff up to no consensus; Here is a typo, not ""Hongbo"", but Feng Po. There are Xu Mingxing, Lilin, Wu Bogey cold, Shofen, Gao Xi Jin and other people.

All these people can testify: ""We argue that we can't take private equity and a large percentage of free money,"" which is not the subject of debate between me and Mr Albert Chan. The scene is probably what I said: ""You said all right, and no one objected, the question is, do you think there are people who do not understand this reason?"" Does that make any sense to you?

” Chen Weixing want to give people the impression that he is in the name of justice with Li Yu to argue, the result of discord ... Sorry, it's not true.

There are many witnesses at the scene.

3. Li xiaolai began in June 2013 to September, raised 30,000 Bitcoin, and verbally promised that it would be guaranteed by Bitcoin, which expired last September and was requested to be postponed for a year; the next September is the time of maturity; This is the industry old people well\-known things, I did not lie; Once again, this is not true. It was ""equivalent to about 20 million yuan"" of private equity funds. And I never promised to be guaranteed by Bitcoin\-my words were ""hoping to win bitcoin."" As for the expiration of last September, this is cover, it is ""4\+1"", so it is due to expire in September this year.

Oh, yes, according to the current performance, after wrote off a lot of items, it seems to be really run to win Bitcoin\-sorry. So, this one, Chen Weixing want to use ""This is the industry old people well\-known things, I did not lie"" fooled the past\-sorry, he still lied. He did not know the secret, so he was irresponsible. Not only that, Chen Weixing around to say Li Yu to owe others 30,000 Bitcoin, this is simply slander, because this fact does not exist, ""owed"" does not exist, ""30,000 Bitcoin"" is also fictitious. I have reminded him that he has the burden of proof or slander. Mr Albert Chan, who does not understand the law, has so far failed to understand what ""burden of proof"" is, or even, I doubt whether he understands the true meaning of the word ""evidence"".

Otherwise, why so many words written out, even a little evidence can not find?

4. Li Yu to raise the Bitcoin, into the just\-dice to gamble, one of the accounts, even created the history of Bitcoin the biggest gambler's reputation, these information high level of people can find online; This one, it is even more ridiculous. At Xu Xiaoping and Feng Po's dinner, Mr Chen faltered to claim that he had begun to touch and invest in Bitcoin in 2013 years ... I did not bother to expose him on the spot, when the currency circle is very small, who do not know who? In the second half of 2013, I did invest in Just\-dice and was the first investor to invest more than 2,500 bitcoin. Because that was the only project that could have been found at the time with Bitcoin and was likely to get a bit of money, and many old people had invested in Just\-dice. On this point, I have never deliberately hidden, I even in a group dedicated to share the logic of investment just\-dice. And Mr Albert Chan deliberately uses sensational words, said Li Yu to money laundering, gambling, and further, to instruct a media staff to forward to other media, the deliberate use of the term ""drug\-related"", which is very dirty behavior\-and, this really may constitute a crime, libel.

Li xiaolai Theoretically could therefore initiate criminal proceedings.

5. Li Yu exchanges Bigone, INB Capital and fund\-raising accounts are mixed with their personal accounts, and to show people their wealth, fictitious its ""richest Man"" illusion; It's too lazy to refute, but it has to be countered.

Once again, there is absolutely no evidence\-and of course not the truth. Mr Albert Chan is actually a fake entrepreneur, although he has always claimed to be a ""founder of the Fast"", but in fact? What is Lu Zhunwei for? In fact, Albert Chan has never done anything complete. It is well known that Chen Weixing had sold the vast majority of his small, fast\-running shares at a time when the fast valuations were not high.

So, whimsical is his thinking loophole, which is why INB eventually lost the ""taxi chain"" The reason for the project\-we decided not to participate. How many assets does the exchange total manage users he knows? The personal assets I have hosted on the exchange are only a small part of myself, and only a smaller portion of the total assets of the exchange. The team ran the exchange for so many years, never lost any virtual assets, how to do? First of all, Yaozhang clear?

If it could have been ""mixed"" as he had imagined, would a database of thousands of transactions per minute be a mess?

6. Li Yu to the idea that there is no public funds concept, the vast majority of his projects have been a large proportion of their pocket, and a large proportion of the free currency in the two\-tier market cast; The most typical of his and OTCBTC's Zheng Yiting tear force is the core reason is that Li xiaolai want to take 40&amp;#37;

To raise funds and Zheng think that they do not have the right to do so, funny is Li xiaolai also so in micro\-Bo scold Zheng Don't speak credit!

""There is no notion of public money in the idea of Li Yu,"" he said, either by Mr Albert's own imagination or by his deliberate labelling. ""The vast majority of his projects were pocketed by a large percentage of them, and a large percentage of the free currency was thrown in the two\-tier market,"" It was framed and defamatory. If Chen Weixing that this is not slander, then, please come up with the evidence, Li Yu to take the money of which project, a large proportion of the coin? And, this is particularly ridiculous: ""A large proportion of free money in the two\-tier market selling""\-please Chen Weixing to come up with evidence, where I took a percentage of the ""free currency""? As for ""in the two\-tier market selling"", Chen Weixing is really do not know me ah! I am the holder of the currency as far as possible.

This is ridiculous, but I can still be so invited: no proof, but Fan Chenwei Star can point out which item on the Li xiaolai took a lot of free money and then in the two market, I can take out the transaction address record of the token, to everyone to see, I just did not move. But now to Chen Weixing's comrades, to give him advice, ""black material"" Erihua, the Investment Penta project is in the name of INB, back to find that the project may be more profitable, became a ""capital"" of the project\-it is also because the founder of the Penta Project initiated with me,

I have the possibility to disclose things openly. About the Zheng incident, just on the internet there is already a public, she and I recorded the call. ""It's nonsense,"" Li xiaolai wanted to take away 40&amp;#37; of the fundraising and Zheng thought he had no right to do so. My request is that as 40&amp;#37; shareholders, 40&amp;#37; of the rights, have the right to jointly manage all the funds raised\-is this not common sense? Zheng wants to portray Li xiaolai as a ""black\-hearted investor"" in public, so please, Zheng after the project has been profitable, at least the Li Yu to the investment money after the return, okay? Greedy for shareholder rights, go back to Taiwan, refuse to answer the phone, and say ""please communicate with my lawyer"", and that lawyer will never answer the phone ...

This is just ""not credit"" Ah, this is simply a rogue\-Albert Chan If you think Zheng is a comrade, I think it is also a matching.

7. I question [Block.one](https://block.one/)'s statement that private accounts for 4 billion of dollars are not responsible for anything, it is hoped that without naming the situation can promote the domestic currency of the public funds reasonable use of the consensus, the result became a Li xiaolai group of EOS personnel to attack me personally, so I had to roll the call.

It's not true, there's no evidence. ""Li xiaolai a group of EOS personnel to attack me personally"" ... All this time, it's you Chen Weixing attacking Li Yu without a baseline, okay? I am really busy, just invested in a hardware company, we are busy every day to discuss how to make a world's largest artificial intelligence Li Yun; also invested in a team ready to do a shared chain, we open the brain hole, brainstorming, and finally got the conclusion that the core of sharing is people, not people to share the car, bicycles, houses, rechargeable treasure ... So we have to change the team structure ... Chen Weixing in the circle of friends, in micro\-blog slander me, to their own face, I am really not free.

Poor me to care about my friends and family, call to greet me, I had to take care of their emotions, so I have to explain to them the ins and outs of this Chen Weixing, wasting my life! As for the so\-called ""so I have to call the roll"", alas, Albert Chan did not do it two days a day.

I'm just too lazy to spend my time on this kind of thing. This is true: many EOS holders run to tweets and scold Albert Chan. Can be honest, this is Albert Chan to find their own scold. The history of EOS, as new in the circle of Albert Chan, is certainly not fully understood. Do not say this, said the most easy to understand the fact: at this stage, EOS and air, also can not say not to practice the taxi chain more air it? EOS again air, also can not be compared to the XMX, Jade Red make more air? Xmx a large area of the EOS code, unexpectedly still and Chen Wei star to say that the EOS is a MLM, is the air, is also a wonderful flower. Don't say, xmx I am also an investor, because Zhaodong Dfund said to return my personal feeling, with them the same condition, so, I invested in the personal name eth\-\-now look back, thanks Ah! From the very beginning, I said I can't advertise with my name.

It's almost the only time I've ever taken the initiative to avoid a pit in the currency circle.

8. I do not have a wallet, do not remember the bank password, although the investment of many exchanges, media, market, wallet, etc., but never let them help me on a currency; This one has nothing to do with me, there is no need to refute, although there is no evidence.

Anyway, if you say so, I'll just listen.

9. Three o'clock the group of several coins, and I have no concern, I was early to help blind people, not and anyone recommended, also think that they should not be over marketing, should do a good job; three o'clock Group of any General Assembly, I did not participate in the organization, my name was stolen is the organizers of the mess; This one has nothing to do with me again. Li Yu to invest in a project, called eos\-\-a good project? It's not air, is it? The air currency is impossible to have original code! \-and then, by Chen Weixing accused of ""no public asset consciousness"" and so on ...

At the expense of slander. Then, Albert Chan cast a project of his own, xmx, that is really the air ah! The white paper copied my investment from another project, was I quietly advised, not willing to direct public anger to the end even the code is copied EOS, this is not air?! This is not what Mr Albert Chan called a leek? I go to his place, do not mention ""public assets"", I do not mention ""public transparency""? However, Chen Weixing to himself is very tolerant: ""I am a blind vote"", and then a word with the finished son? Do not know have Wang Weixing, Sun Weixing, Yang Wei star what's to frontline frontline him?

Now I want to get rid of my relationship with ""three o'clock""\-who was in the middle of the night in the Three o'clock crowd?

10. I do not have any personal direct conflict of interest with Li Yu, it is a conflict of values, let me in this industry to vomit, I personally do not have the will and no need to rub this hot excrement to provoke Sao, don't need to rely on him to make up for himself; ""I don't have any personal direct conflict of interest with Li Yu""\-\-I thought so, and now a little unsure. ""Conflict of Values""? Agree.

The values of Li xiaolai and Chen Weixing are indeed different. 11. My plea is clear, that is, hope that the industry bosses can form a ""no corruption"" consensus.

If you do, you will never be able to! Please Mr Albert Chan to seek truth from facts: ""No corruption"" consensus, do not need Chen Weixing advocacy, this is common sense, any normal person should do things.

Mr Albert Chan refers to Li xiaolai corruption, but does not provide evidence, this is slander. What do you mean, principled? Just one example. Cloud currency, before the shutdown, is even the virtual currency handling fee income is converted into the day of the renminbi calculation, and then paid in full tax. This, anyone can go to Beijing Haidian Tax Bureau to verify. That's the kind of team I trust. This is called a principle, the principle is to stick to their own, not used to shout, nor do they can not do it everywhere to ask others. I guess: This team is theoretically probably one of the very few (or even the only) people on Earth so far.

Active and fully taxable virtual asset Exchange? For the past two months, I have been very confused about one thing. Because there is another person, the founder of a certain media, was waved as a gun by Chen Wei Star. This man used her pen to save a friend of mine and is now a partner. So, after understanding the ins and outs, I am very strange, this is obviously once a ""messenger of Justice"", how to become this way? Just because Chen Weixing was her investor, she completely lost her ability to discriminate? As a senior media person, do not have the most basic training? Should ""the word have basis"" be regarded as the most basic principle and the bottom line of the word? Even try to communicate face\-to\-face, no fruit.

The mouth is full of sounding words, secretly doing all the things without the bottom line. I don't know if I guessed right, she's the same person as Chen Weixing, they are not ""the embodiment of righteousness"", they are not ""messengers of righteousness"", they are just ""people who use justice as a tool for self\-interest""\-\-even if it is irrelevant to facts, principles, or even the bottom line, any ""justice"" can be waved as a stick if it can achieve a goal."

Im talking about the devleoping economies. All of them are usually very corrupt and do not have people in power that put the interests of the citizens first.

Bitcoin might continue going down in value, but when your currency starts losing 40% every year like Argentina, Bitcoin wont seem like a crazy choice.

Also keep in mind that its incredibly difficult to buy dollars/euros in most countries. A lot of them have many barriers to the amount you can purchase daily/weekly/monthly/yearly, and they also carry a huge premium. This is also just viable for the upper class because everyone else has no idea of how to bank or even have a bank.

If you live in a strong country like the US, China, Japan, Germany etc., chances are you wont need Bitcoin any time soon, but when half the world starts dropping their shitty currencies you will need to adopt BTC to keep the commerce going.

And just like we couldnt imagine what the internet/tech would bring us 20 years ago, we have no idea of how crazy the world will be in the next 20. Im only certain of 1 thing and that is that BTC will still be alive."

If this were a rational market, following a linear trend, the price of Bitcoin today would be somewhere in the range of 10-15k. Shorting Bitcoin at 18k, 15k, 12k, 10k, or even 8k during Q1/Q2 2018, I get. But shorting Bitcoin at 8k, 6k, or even 4k during Q3 2018, I don't get.

If you believe in the long term vision of Bitcoin, you see the value and understand why, $6k, as of June 2018, a nearly 70% correction, is no longer an overvalued asset.

Personally, I don't trade BTC, I accumulate during corrections. I welcome the cheaper prices but trying to drive the price down by shorting, in order to accumulate more BTC, at the expense of your fellow margin longs is, at best, futile, at worst, a sadist and narcissistic effort."

Holders and shorters are the two sides of a coin. Both are market manipulations. Holders are making markets less liquidity. They drives the price up, by making supply less. What is the purpose of holding? To buy Lambo and live a rockstar life? Don’t tell me that you won’t sell when it gets 20k let’s say. I don’t believe. 
Shorting is obvious. The same reason behind the scenes. But less less lies. 

What is the purpose of the “free money”? To be used as day to day life. 
Don’t you see, both are driving away the merchants, the buyers. 
History is that this strategies are patented by banks. And later they will state that we were warned this is a bubble. And will offer to use their “fair fiat”. 

Please correct if I am wrong. But I see that there are greedy people everywhere and gives a bad name to good ideas. They just wants to discredit it. They manipulate the price. You need both holders and shorters in order to make it l as stable as a way to avoid mass adoption. "

University of Texas finance professor John Griffin, who has a 10-year track record of spotting financial fraud, and graduate student Amin Shams examined millions of transactions on cryptocurrency exchange **Bitfinex**. In a 66-page paper, the authors found that **tether** was used to buy bitcoin at key moments when it was declining, which helped ""stabilize and manipulate"" the cryptocurrency's price.

""Fraud and manipulation often leave footprints in the data and it's nice to have the blockchain to track things,"" Griffin told.

Is it possible for a wallet to automatically handle the opening and closing of payment channels behind the scenes? Bit hard to get mass adoption if we have to explain to ppl how to open a channel, send payment, pay for channel, close channel etc. 

It's early days with LN but hoping someone more experienced can chime in here. I think opening a channel costs BTC right? Again, how much does this cost and can it be handled by a wallet automatically?"

During the tweet storm it puzzled him at what the value of btc would have to be a the world’s currency. If the world’s assets, debts, and derivatives are equal to $900T that means each btc has to be worth $50 million. But his thought is wrong. The world doesn’t have $900T in currency. The world has about $90T in currency. The rest is covered under the unit of account property of money. 

I advise most of you who read this to be careful at those who are Blockchain, tokenizers, smart contractors and the sort. They are all trying to say they are better than bitcoin. But they all have fundamental flaws at what bitcoin is set out for. The end result we want for bitcoin is not just a medium of exchange. Nor is it a means of exchange. (Fast transactions) It is to become a unit of account. 

For those who are reading this and also invest in multiple projects. Understand this. Bitcoin is being developed to be a unit of account to replace or run in parallel with other units of accounts. ($,€,£,¥) We are not competing with Visa. We are not competing with Facebook or Google. We are not competing with ETH, BCH, or whatever altcoin. We are competing to become a world reserve currency. The tech is important but so is the monetary issue. No other project is focused on this. They have founders with coin rewards or premines. No nation state is ever going to allow a developer or founder of a coin or token ever reach the point of unit of account. "

I don't think any of us are shy to the Deep State and Conspiracy theories.  But in the Link above, it states that DARPA's life Log program was cancelled the day Facebook was founded. If we connect the dots, we can conclude, facebook is most likely a continuation of DARPA's program. 

So if its a sham and Zuckerberg is more of a figure head and fake founder, then the whole story with the Winklevoss twins might be bull shit too. 

What are you gonna believe ""more"", some nerd starts a multi billion international by himself/with friends. 

Or what about, if he kind of stole the idea from some kids at harvard, and there was this law suit and you know its totally real. 

(I bet harvard has some kind of version of skull and bones society) 

SO. If facebook is more or less bullshit, then the winklevoss have to be also. Is Bitcoin their payment, along with the lawsuit to play along? 'Here is a large piece of the new economy in the coming years. stfu and play along' 

And I've always found it weird how the US protects its citizens from across border scams, which is why its so hard for US citizens to be part of many exchanges, but the US gov't has been so lenient on Bitcoin. Yeah they do these smoke shows where they pretend to be mean to Bitcoin, but they are letting it happen. And Its all over wall street with Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, Digital Currency Group and so on. 

I'm not saying its bad. I'm just saying this might not be so grassroots as we think. "

Now its time for the next step. Multi sig has been around for a while, and can be used with a 3rd party arbitrator. Traditionally credit cards will act as an arbitrator, think of credit cards as having 180 day escrow, the time limit for chargebacks.

most big companies use bp, and bp does some vetting to make sure the company provides good service. but bp still expects you to send direct.

while they companies are trust worthy, and will correct issues with product quality, they are getting people comfortable with sending direct, with no form of protection. new users who are just getting started have no awareness of the issue.

Many people like to support smaller businesses. and there are lots of great small businesses out there that will do everything they can to provide good products/services. But there are many fake small business scammers out there. Escrow can protect against this.

Sites big and small could get hacked, users could end up on the wrong site, and blindly send btc to the wrong address. and arbitrator might catch this.

arbitration is not perfect and can also have issues, or an arbitrator could be a scammer. Its important that arbitration be decentralized, not just one big company like bp, but lots of individuals.

When the consumer losses out due to scams the consumer is a direct victim. but it also hurts the bitcoin community, giving a bad image, and good businesses end up with customer base that has less money to put towards the good businesses that deserve it.

There are a few ways to go about using escrow with multisig. The first is direct wallets, with manual setup. Electrum and bp wallets are wallets that support multisig. the most popular way would be a 2 of 3 wallet. where 2 signers out of 3 people are needed to finalize a transaction. if everything goes well the buyer and seller are involved. if there is an issue the arbitrator will review evidence, and side with one or the other. Manual also allows for upto 10 signers) The other ways are a more automated way of doing the same thing. Bitrated is one of them. the buyer will select someone they will be buying off, and an arbitrator. it also allows you to link social media, and has a rating system based on your social media following/reputation, and your trades on platform. The other popular place is OpenBazaar. In OpenBazaar2 anyone can be an arbitrator, there is also a verified moderator, that has been checked by the OpenBazaar team to be a good bitcoin community member. also unmentionables can be used in OpenBazaar2. Bithalo is similar to openbazaar but with double escrow, this gives both buyer and seller more incentive to be serious and honest. I meant to play with it more, but i was inspired to start writing and get this out.

Bisq is an exchange, one of the only ones where you have the keys. currently the developer serves as the arbitrator, but hopefully in future releases it will be opened up to members of the community. Bisq is software that runs on mac/win/linux for exchanging fiat to/from btc or btc to/from unmentionables. All other exchanges you don't have the keys, and should not be trusted as much as people do. Binance is looking to become more like bisq, but currently binance is centralized and has the key. as far as I know, no other exchange is working towards this for bitcoin. there are some other decentralized exchanges- I'll leave this out, auto mod picked out some stuff.

Manual Multisig is good for private, and one time use, or long term agreements where the wallets can be left active. Bitrated is good for checking reputation, and setting one time offers. OpenBazaar is good for the seller to list items for sale. The seller will choose various acceptable arbitrators, and from that list the buyer can choose an arbitrator. Have a significant number of arbitrators to choose from (manual may be difficult to find).

An additional advantage to utilizing multisig for bitcoin enthusiasts is more people will be hodling potentially for a few hours, days or even month. This can drive the btc price up.

an additional issue, especially for projects that may take weeks or months is price volatility. you'll have to agree on if you are strictly priced in btc, or if you are using a fiat exchange rate at the start of the transaction, or at the end of the transaction. or you might give the option to be whatever is more advantages to the business or customer.

This opens up some spaces for new companies to become arbitrators, and certain people may like a well established arbitrator, while others might like the small individual arbitrator. Anyone of the parties could even set themselves up to hedge the exchange rate to make more interesting offers.

I would hope that those who are true believers will start using escrow soon, and get people in the habit of transacting safely. Overstock seems to be a bitcoin ally so I hope to see them start sooner. Expedia seems like they just care about customer demand and the profit, so I don't expect as much from. There are many other examples, I just didn't want to spend the time to go through everything. There's lots of people already on bitrated, and openbazaar, that maybe need a little reminder, just how important their part is in escrow, and keeping the bitcoin community strong

Here is my understanding:

Miners adds txs to a block, so it needs to make sure the tx's are legit (no double spend). That is why each mining node should run a full node, so it has a copy of the blockchain to check the ledger. 

Now once the POW is done (nonce+extra nonce is guessed), and a block is mined, this block is send to Full nodes for consensus. 

Then the TXs are verified against the ledger and  the info is propagated across the network.

From my understanding Mining full node does two jobs 1. Mining and 2. Consensus (maintain ledger).  //lets just consider full nodes, and not go into pruned/spv etc.

Full Node does just once: Consensus. 

So both nodes are needed from where I see. 
But why on twitter, mutiple people say ""If you are not running mining node with a full node, your full node is useless""?

Hey
One user on the reddit cheated me for $ 30 in bitccoins that doubled this amount twice, he guaranteed that I would receive my money - he had 14k karma so I believed him. I have depression, problems at home and at school so I could easily get fucked. I know that this is a funny amount for you but I wanted to invest some of it in the knowledge and the rest to invest CONFIDENCE on the matches of the national team during the World Cup.
I analyze bets from subreddita sportsbook, soccerbetting and I always won. I know what the risk is and I do it very carefully, I do not invest the whole amount but I know what to put on. I go to school and work in odd jobs but I miss it for household payments (I'm not doing well at home). Later, I wanted to invest in Dascoin. I know that it can work, but it is different than what the user offered. The day after I bitcoin him, he wrote to me that he suddenly burned the hard disk and I will not get my bitcoins back :( What can I do to get my money back?"

8r9sdp,1529056905,davorpc,1,19,Have you heard about Trailing Stop Loss order?,"I stumbled upon this not long ago and it got my attention. What are your thoughts?

Unique Trailing Stop Loss order by CoinPulse Exchange: 

A Revolution Step towards Stop Loss Pricing! This a powerful, hard-to-find feature which allows users to set a stop order that will be automatically adjusted each time the asset moves 20&amp;#37; upward from the price it was started at. There will be a standard stop loss with an optional checkbox that will trigger the Trailing Stop Loss feature, for e.g. if you want to sell an asset only if it goes down 10&amp;#37; from the current price, you set a regular Stop Loss Limit as such. When you check the Trailing Stop Loss option, the order will execute as usual at the price you set it if the asset then goes down to that 10&amp;#37; threshold, but if the asset’s price first goes up by 20&amp;#37;, the Stop Limit will also go up by 20&amp;#37; from the original stop loss limit you set. Each time the asset goes up by 20&amp;#37; increments, your sell price protection (Stop Limit) also goes up by 20&amp;#37;, thereby letting you automatically take advantage of the asset moving in your favor without having to readjust the Stop Limit to benefit from the overall increase in the asset price. The Trailing Stop Loss option, denoted by “i”, will be placed beside the Stop Loss option. Traders will have to “check” it in order to avail the benefit of automatic stop loss trailing. The stop loss price will keep increasing in 20&amp;#37; increments at every 20&amp;#37; increase in the original asset price. The Trailing Stop Loss, once updated by the system (i.e. when 20&amp;#37; increase is registered), will change only upwards at every 20&amp;#37; increment based on the asset’s price. It will never go downwards unless the user cancels the stop loss order. Note: Trailing Stop Loss will work in Sats and not in $ value. Users must set their trade values based on prices in Sats (1 Sat is the lowest fraction of BTC). "

8r9wby,1529058310,slvbtc,56,25,"""Money just wants to be one""","Since when has 200 different national currencies been good for global trade, forex risk, fair global competition between businesses etc. 

How efficient is a business when you need to waste time and resources dedicating effort to following the forex market instead of focusing on your product. What if you dedicate 30 years to building a competative advantage only to see that advantage wiped out in 1 month because your nations currency rises against other currencies.

The whole point of inventing ""money"" was to do away with barter because barter is inefficient. In fact the ""invention"" of money was just people deciding to use one single store of value for trade within a community to maximize efficiency of trade instead of using many different mediums (barter).

We now live in one globalized community so we should logically use one globalized currency to make trade more efficient and fair.

When you think about it we literally have a system of inefficient barter today trying to trade global currencies with eachother. Forex is currency barter!

""Money just wants to be one"" - Saifedean Ammous

Even over the last 50 years we saw the world trending towards a system of one global reserve currency (USD) where it was permitted. Not that it will last because it gives one countries government the ability to export inflation to the detriment of other countries economies, which will not last over the long term. Infact the USD is crumbling as we speak because it gives advantage to the US over other countries. 

We need a politically neutral global currency not controlled by any one government.

Bitcoin will be the one global store of value used as money, all other cryptos will be pay-per-use, where if you want to use a dapp for example your smart wallet ""atomically"" swaps into other cryptos by the second to pay for it.

It is fine to have one global currency when that currency is politically neutral and not forced on the world but is instead voluntarily adopted. Infact it is the only logically way forward for humanity."

Among them there are a total of five different blockchain companies as well as those dedicated to ERF research of cyber security and artificial intelligence. Below are companies that deal extensively with crypto and blockchain technologies. For a complete list of companies, visit the Wall Street Journal website.

# 2 Blockstream Corp. 
The largest of the WSJ valued companies, which deals with the blockchain or crypto currencies block Stream Corp. The startup from Montreal was founded in 2014 by a team consisting of Adam Beck, Matt Corallo and Alexander Fowler founded. Currently, a total of 50 employees work on projects of the company. Blockstream Corp. is currently working to improve the Bitcoin network and to develop technologies to support micropayments. They are also looking for ways to create a system for receiving intercontinental exchange cryptocurrency data.

# 6 R3
The company has also been at the forefront of the WSJ list over the past few months with a lot of media attention. There were rumors last week that they are facing bankruptcy, but the company denies these reports. R3 is developing a blockchain-based platform that enables secure transactions between companies and financial institutions. R3 was founded in 2015 in New York.

# 11 Digital Asset Holdings LLC
Another blockchain company that impressed the Wall Street Journal staff is Digital Asset Holdings LLC. Like R3, this New York firm works on fast and secure operations between financial institutions. In addition, they also work closely with the largest stock exchange in Australia.

# 12 Brave Software Inc.
Brave was founded in 2015 by Brian Bondi and Brendan Eich. The company currently employs around 60 people and is headquartered in San Francisco. Last year, Brave successfully launched its own privacy-oriented browser package. They are also working on next-generation advertising solutions with their BAT token. Also interesting is her recent collaboration with Dow Jones.

# 13 Abra
Abra was founded in 2014 by Bill Barghidt and James D. Robinson. The Californian company currently employs 50 people. Abra’s official name is Plutus Financial Inc. Abra has developed a mobile application that allows users to invest in 25 different digital assets and 50 fiat currencies. The wallet service allows users to track prices and exchange different currencies.

The last issue of the Wall Street Journal was less pleasing on the blockchain world. Among other things, they said last month that in 271 ICO projects presented, several were given a red flag to indicate some kind of fraud."

8razpl,1529069799,aelaos1,89,158,It's the first time in history a graduate paper wiped billions from an asset..,"That's how crazy cryptospace is..

So let's take things from the start. There is one academic paper written by a graduate student under the supervision of his professor. We all know what that means. Hungry for drama media take up the article and post it (NY times). Regardless of whether it's true or false, one could use this as a major manipulation. If you know this article is being printed and you know how the immature market overreacts it's prime shorting time. What an irony when posting an article about manipulator...you are the manipulator.

In any case, there was another article here [http://www.tetherreport.com/](http://www.tetherreport.com/) that finds absolutely no correlation with prices increases. Why should I believe a graduate student vs someone else that conducted statistical analysis? Well, we collectively panicked on one article and totally dismissed the other one.

Why? Economic theory always suggests that negative news have more power than positive ones as we have seen during the last months, we have a super influx of positive news to which the market does not react.

Still, my thoughts about Tether are summed up from this series of Tweets from someone I respect:[https://twitter.com/matt\_odell/status/1006885981797208064](https://twitter.com/matt_odell/status/1006885981797208064)

He has a nice wording but I also need to add a couple of things I keep repeating.

1. ALL of the exchanges that use Tether do not seem to be worried. Either they are STUPID or they are convinced that there is no immediate threat from Tether. Conspiracy zionists will say that they are all in this together. Well I'm not a flat earther on this one.
2. Can you think of one promiment crypto famous person that publicly said he is worried about Tether? I am not talking about Twitter OGs I am talking about Binance CEO for example who seems completely confident Tether is not a scam since he offered insurance in case something happens or other exchange CEOs etc? NONE
3. Tether on purpose does not want to get public with the bank accounts since many governments may start picking on them. It serves a very convenient purpose to the ecosystem.
4. Tether guys have a big vested interest in Bitcoin not failing, they are already gazzillionaires and have no reason to scam. If you have hundreds of millions already, would you run a scam to get some more threatening imprisonment? I wouldn't.
5. Tether has a confirmed bank account with the biggest Dutch bank. Do you think one of the most scrutinizing banks under EU legislation would host billions of a scam scheme?
6. Few understand that you need to increase and decrease the supply of a pegged asset. They just mindlessly repeat ""tether printer"" like an army of tools without understanding what is it's purpose while it is described in their technical documentation.
7. We have more stable coins now in case I am wrong. Can you just chill?

p.s I don't work for Tether, I am not a paid shill etc etc. I am just trying to put my 2 cents to make this market more efficient (because I am a long term investor that profits from rationality vs day traders that profit from madness). So no, this post is not completely altruistic obviously."

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
 Hello It's me again. In short, I was cheated by @Zeredder. He guaranteed that he would double my bitcoins using bots and algorithms on the stock exchange. He used the fact that I have depression and problems at home and at school and I let myself be fucked. It was a small and ridiculous amount (30$), but I invested this money in bookmaker's and I also wanted to spend on learning programming - education. I am very careful, I'm betting with types from subreddits  ""sportsbook"" and ""soccerbetting"" so I always manage to win. In addition, I know when to stop and how much to bet. Later I wanted to invest the money in Dascoin, here I know that there is a risk but he did not have the right to appropriate them if he guaranteed that I would receive money.I work in odd jobs but it's hard to get along at home and I wanted to make my dreams come true. And a few hours after I sent him bitcoins, he wrote that he had burned his equipment and now he says nothing. But he really did not have the right to appropriate them, just say how GUARANTEED and ""fooled"" .. I got fucked, I do not know - I would never have a conscience to rob someone, in case what money would be very important for him to leave from losing, for education :(


I know, I got a lesson, but how can I get it back? Now nothing is written off and this amount really means a lot to me, even if I want to invest in knowledge. I'm not rich and you do not know my current situation, so it's hard to understand that it's a lot for me. "

The problem is that, as you know, you can't access  your tokens in eToro. No private keys, no recovery phrase, nothing. Just buy and sell in $. I like trading but I would like also to move my tokens to some wallet and hodl. 

So I discovered GDAX.  I can trade there but it also gives me control over my tokens so I can move them to some wallet if I want. 

So, please, tell me if this makes sense: I plan, in the short term, to stop all my crypto trading in eToro and move my crypto trading to GDAX. I will keep eToro for stocks and the like and use GDAX for cryptos but also for moving my assets to wallets whenever I want. Does all this make sense to you or am I missing something?

Yes, I've heard that eToro plans to provide wallets in the short term but, who knows when? Also, they are famous for charging huge feeds!

Thanks. "

I mean if more and more people are learning the difference between bitcoin and fiat and are entering BTC as HODLers, then from every side I see it their ability to manipulate the price is very limited.  Especially if people are coming into BTC and moving their coins off exchanges and into cold storage solutions.   I've heard a lot of theories about how bitcoin futures have been a huge reason for why the price has declined and the only way I can see a correlation here would be if people are buying OTC BTC, shorting it, then dumping it on the regular exchanges and collecting the profits.  Unless they are the banks / vested fiat interests, then I don't see exactly why they would do this as I would think any investor in this area would see the potential for bitcoin to be a superior MOE, SOV, and UOA in the not too distant future and go long. If it its manipulation via futures and OTC shorting by the banks, then I can't see why they would choose this approach as these coins are sold on open markets and more and more people are scooping them up daily. Any thoughts or comments are appreciated. "

I've read that Breadwallet was the best wallet for iOS, would that be good if I wanted to use that as a middle man between Coinbase and the sportsbook?

If you believe that BCH is Satoshi’s true vision, that’s ok. You are entitled to your opinion. I have no problem with that.

""...most people found the change traumatic, the millennials fared best as they had little to begin with and adapted best to the new system. Older people with pensions and people who had become dependent on the state fared the worse, but generally except for the few who has made preparations life became much harder. 

 
The collapse began in early September 2018. Deutchbank was the first to go, after the ECB refused to guarantee its obligations to other banks, shortly after Barclays, HSBC and Santander. The contagion spread and eventually all banks, even Goldman Sachs collapsed too. The IMF and World Bank were overwhelmed, nothing could be done. Afterwards the true extent of their criminality became apparent. Many of the assets they said they had did not exist or been stolen and what assets they did have  were now worthless as the buyers (other banks) had all gone bankrupt too. Many bankers disappeared, lots were arrested and quite a few killed themselves.


Throughout the world governments had guaranteed most peoples savings, it very quickly became apparent that due to the size of the collapse this would not be possible. Instead the government issued savers with 'peoples saver bonds' which were to be held for 5 years and paid 8% interest. Initially these bonds traded at a premium due to the -2.5% interest rate set by the Bank Of England. However since the collapse most businesses  had closed and the economy was entirely government driven. Huge sums of money were created with the aim of kick starting the economy back to life. Inflation began to creep in, 10% then 20%, the peoples saver bonds began to trade at a discount 99p to the pound, 95p to the pound. Eventually as inflation hit 500% they were worthless. The government tried to stop inflation by reducing the supply of physical cash, first £50 note were no longer legal tender, then new £10 and £20 notes where issued with the old ones no longer to be used. This had the opposite effect, people no longer trusted that their cash had value so spent it as quick as possible driving up prices even more. Inflation peaked at 630% but by then the damage had been done. Throughout the world all government issued fiat was no longer trusted or accepted.


As the old currencies died so did the power once held by the governments that issued them, the USA fared the worse, no longer able to afford its armies it became a irrelevance. All countries suffered however those with natural resources, gold or crypto-reserves fared the best. 


In September as the collapse was underway attention turned to Bitcoin, they idea of being able to transfer value from A to B without the need for trusting a 3rd party i.e. a bank brought in many large businesses. Also a growing number of people whilst wary and skeptical of using bitcoin thought that their money would be safer in bitcoin than in a bank or held in cash. As the price of bitcoin became more and more expensive the trust in cash diminished. By December bitcoin was now over £1M, it could have been £10M or £100M, even £1B it was irrelevant now. As people frantically converted their life savings from pounds to Bitcoin, receiving a few thousand Satoshi's, the old system was now all but dead.


In a last ditch attempt to keep hold of some kind of power governements begain to mine Bitcoin. For many people reality hit home to how severe the situation had become when during the winter of 2018 the country had rolling blackouts as power was diverted to mining operations. Many people died during a particualrly harsh cold snap around Christmas. Whilst the government did mange to mine some bitcoin it too little too late. As the government collapsed in the chaos the bitcoins mined appear to have been stolen...""

This is quite clearly wrong in my opinion. The price of Tether is effectively pegged by the way they sell it for $1, and promise to buy it back for $1. The market has faith in this promise and therefore values it at around $1. It is not a true peg, but it is effectively pegged due to market faith.         
    
I have argued this point with people many times but it just goes round in circles, they usually give up as they cannot provide any proof, logic or reasoning as to why they are right, but their opinion remains unchanged and so they continue spreading it around the forums.          

I am hoping that this thread can settle this in peoples minds once and for all, as it is important to realise that the USDT peg is purely a psychological one that rests on Tethers promise of buying it back. Without that, USDT is free-floating.          
Please provide some constructive debate below so we can settle this as a community and stop the spread of misinformation!

So within a few years, many of the current 'mining' calculation processes will be made *trivial* and will burst many of the existing cryptocurrencies.

They had better start thinking now some other calculation mechanisms to adopt to base them on.

8rjbve,1529155537,MasonicCoiner,0,26,How I explained Bitcoin to a child,"This is how I explained to my 10 year old niece how Bitcoin increases in value...

""Imagine a big lake that has 21 million magic sponges floating on it. The water in the lake is all the money in the world, and each sponge is a Bitcoin. 
Each of the sponges slowly starts to soak up the water in the lake, but  world governments are constantly pouring more water into the lake, so as the sponges soak up more water, the level of the water in the lake doesn't really drop. The sponges aren't controlled by any government and no more of them can be put into the lake the way the government keeps adding more water. 
These are magic sponges because they can keep getting bigger and bigger, soaking up more and more water and can never get full. 
Eventually people realise that it makes more sense to own a sponge than the water, as they will  get more water that way as long as the sponges keep growing. When millions of people around the world start buying the sponges, they go up in value because there is only 21 million of them for everyone. But there's not enough sponges for every person in the world. As these are magic sponges, each sponge is actually made up of 100,000,000 tiny sponges. So if you're one of the lucky few who owns a full sponge, or even lots of the tiny ones, you can sell them to other people for their water or swap them for a house, car or anything else. The longer you keep your sponge, and as more people want them, you will be able to buy even more stuff. Eventually people won't want to sell their sponges for water anymore, and will want to use them just to buy houses and other stuff. 
The government probably won't be happy with this, as they want people to use the water which they control, and not the sponges which they dont control. They might try to scare people to get them to sell their sponges and stop using the sponges to buy stuff. Some people will be scared, but it will be very difficult to stop everyone using them. 
At some stage, the government will realise that nobody wants to use the water anymore because the sponges are better and they might decide to stop pouring more water into the lake. 
If this happens, the lake won't have any more water in it, and will just be a dry lake full of huge sponges. The people who started buying the sponges first when they were really small were able to buy the most amount of sponges. The bigger they get, the more expensive they get and that means most people will only be able to afford a small amount of the tiny sponges."" 

It might sound like a load of nonsense but my niece now has a good understanding of Bitcoin in a way that she can relate too. She already wants Bitcoin for her birthday.

Coinbase, the largest Bitcoin exchange, just gave Bitcoin's openness a giant middle finger by banning Gab, the free speech social network, from their platform.

Bitcoin is supposed to be anti-censorship.  But it can't be that if the on-ramps into Bitcoin are controlled by biased gatekeepers who ban people they don't like.

And worse yet, they're setting a precedent that other bitcoin businesses may follow.  How long until you get banned?

If you agree this is a dangerous precedent to set, contact @coinbase on Twitter and let them know won't be using them unless they reinstate Gab's account.

Billionaire venture capitalist and investor Tim Draper has long been one of cryptocurrency’s biggest bulls, and that has not changed during the first half of 2018, even as the bitcoin price has sunk more than 67 percent from its all-time high.

Draper, as CCN reported, has predicted that the bitcoin price will reach $250,000 by 2022, a far cry from the estimated $650 per coin that he paid in 2014 when he won nearly 30,000 BTC from the US Marshals Service in the famous Silk Road auction.

Speaking with financial publication TheStreet, Draper said that the recent market downturn has not caused his confidence in that forecast to waver.

“Price-wise, we’ll continue to see Bitcoin move higher. I’ve revised my estimate up to $250,000 four years out, so we’ll see Bitcoin trade around the $250,000 mark in 2022.”

Draper said that he is basing this bet on the expectation that cryptocurrencies — he’s invested in more than just bitcoin — will “increase the velocity of money” such that the global currency market will hit $140 trillion within the next decade.

“I expect that since cryptocurrencies will increase the velocity of money, the current $86 trillion global market for currency will grow to be about $140 trillion in the next 10 years, and that growth will be in crypto. In fact, I estimate that fiat currencies will actually decrease in use, and that crypto will become as much as $100 trillion of that market. I expect Bitcoin to be about 10% of that market, or $10 trillion. There is a lot of room to grow there.”"

He did it like this : He bought 6 sewing machines that had serial numbers on them , not worth more than 200$ (but was the latest 6 sewing machines of that types, thought they not worth more than 200$ when he bought them) , after that he put up an advertisement stating that he buys sewing machines with those serial numbers , each one for 10,000$

After a year and no buyer(because he had them,so nobody else can sell it to him) he made a new AD saying he buys them for 20,000$ each and so on

After some years he pulls a big scam by selling his machines for I dont remember what price , and he sells them as in time(3-4 years) people knew that there is someone who buys those machines for hell of a price , but all he did was a scam.

Can this be true with bitcoin ? Can satoshi by 1clicking delete all the bitcoins ? Leaving everyone in an empty field ?

I followed the open innovation minor the study provides, where I can basically choose any subject that I want to learn about, and make something :). For me that subject was blockchain, being in bitcoin for almost 5 years triggered my interest to really learn about the tech behind it.

When I started with the minor I was a little clueless about what exactly blockchain was good for, hearing mixed things about it online for so long. On one side blockhain promises huge potential for all sorts of usecases but when I started looking in to it I realized that there really aren't that many legit usecases and that money and bitcoin is what the discussion should really be about. BITCOIN IS THE KILLER APP.

Teachers weren't very exited about my findings in the first place and kept pushing that there must be a lot of other things blockchain is good for, it took me a while to gather the right arguments to convince them that they shouldn't be looking a blockchain but instead focus a bit more(if not completely) on bitcoin. Anyway, one idea that stood out and that fitted limited time that I had in the minor was a gambling site, using the block hash as a random source. Not a new concept but I figured it would be a good one to learn about the tech. So I created https://www.blockhash.win/ where players can earn 2x their bet amount by guessing the right last digit of the blockhash that includes their transaction. I've spend many hours developing and I've learned a lot. I would recommend any software engineer or student like me to learn about the tech and build somthing. I learned a lot from the book that I picked up for this minor: Mastering bitcoin by Andreas M. Antonopoulos (I would really recommend the book if your a software guy or just technical!)

I'm open for feedback and I'm really curious what you guys think of it, let me know :) If you would like to get started developing something bitcoin and don't know where to get started, hit me up! Don't cry about bitcoin's price, learn about the tech and develop something or contribute to an existing project."

8rtaca,1529262921,slvbtc,140,158,Just some quick and very interesting math. $150 worth of btc today is the worlds smartest insurance plan on the future.,"Total money stock in the world is currently $84 trillion.

$84 trillion ÷ 7 billion people = $12,000

We wont have 21 million coins in existance for our lifetimes, and I am guessing if bitcoin does end up dominating as global money it will take no more than another 20 years to do so, so lets use a conservative number of bitcoins, taking into account estimates of lost coins. Call it 19,000,000.

19 million ÷ 7 billion people = 0.0027 bitcoin.

In essence this means if bitcoin works and dominates as global money sometime over the next 20 years then 0.0027 bitcoin will purchase the same amount of goods and services that $12,000 purchases today.

$12,000 × 83.33 = $1,000,000

0.0027 btc × 83.33 = 0.225 bitcoin

Conclusion:

Even you hate bitcoin you need to admit that no one knows what the future holds. So there is no way of knowing if bitcoin will work or not.

Think of bitcoin ownership as insurance on the future.

Today you can purchase 0.225 bitcoin for $1460.

If bitcoin dies well you lost some money but it wont affect your life drastically, but if bitcoin works you have guaranteed yourself a $1 million dollar ""equivelant"" fortune.

Today you can purchase 0.0225 bitcoin for $146. 

If bitcoin works this would give you an amount of bitcoin in the future that would purchase the same as $100,000 does today. If bitcoin dies you lost $146, so what.

I know people may pick holes in this math and subsequent conclusion. But my point remains the same. 

Owning even a tiny amount of bitcoin today like 0.0225 btc is insurance on the future. 

Even if I thought bitcoin would never work it would be stupid of me not to buy $150 worth just incase I was wrong."

They put their cards in backwards or upside down.  They select the wrong payment information or enter their PIN incorrectly.  They pull their card out before the payment has been processed.  EVERY DAY.  

My point is that we have a long way to go before Bitcoin can become widely adopted, maybe even decades.  Lengthen your time horizon.  Stop checking the price on a daily basis.  

I believe in the tech.  I'll continue to be an advocate for Bitcoin, but it's going to take time.  Patience is a virtue after all :)

The Bitcoin price today is now officially less than half of what it was at the start of 2018. Sudden 12&amp;#37; price pullbacks are being blamed on the hacking of obscure South Korean exchange, Coinrail. In terms of market cap, the recent Bitcoin market crash has seen the cryptocurrency market lose over $42 billion in value

As a Bitcoin trader, have you ever happened to do business with South Korean exchange Coinrail?

Thanks to Coinrail being the 90th least most popular cryptocurrency  exchange in the world, there is a strong likelihood that you’ve never  heard of the platform. – At least not until recently. Coinrail, after  all, is currently being blamed for single-handedly wiping $42 billion  from the cryptocurrency market. Specifically, thanks to a June 10th  weekend hack.

There is just one problem. Namely, that Coinrail is most certainly not to blame for the recent Bitcoin Crash.

Also, a reminder that quantum bits use sodium ions that goes away right after it’s used for ONE calculation, not even going to mention how almost impossible it is to stop the noise of that calculation or the necessity to keep a quantum computer at near 0 degrees when there’s 1500 quantum bits. Also, Bitcoin can have quantum proof algorithms.

Bitcoin’s thundering accomplishment towards the finish of 2017 demonstrated compelling to Indian financial specialists, in spite of bits of gossip that India’s national bank could put a stop to the token.

Right now bitcoin has not been prohibited or restricted, but rather India’s significant back organizations don’t remember it as lawful delicate.

India’s muddled association with bitcoin is all the more strange in light of the fact that neither the Government nor the **Reserve Bank of India** (**RBI**) has formally clasped down on it, however, have moved toward it with a tangible level of antagonistic vibe.

8rxn42,1529306871,danredux,82,51,"Finally dipping my toes in BTC, very excited and grateful!","TL;DR: This subreddit has been awesome, my friend has been amazing telling me about Bitcoin, and I decided to get involved in my own limited way!

I've been following Bitcoin for a few years now. At first I loved it for the technical aspects, as a programmer it was fascinating to me. I played with the mining idea to see if I could use in other ways, like games. I've even been experimenting with creating a distributed database based  on the blockchain.

I met a coworker 4 years ago who was a bitcoin fanatic, and I talked with him about it often. He's an anarcho-capitalist who believes Bitcoin to be the future. We had some great debates, and I slowly turned. We've been great friends even after we stopped working together. He taught me about where Bitcoin stands, not just as technology but as an idea, about what fiat currency means, all that jazz.

This year, on his birthday, I decided to get him some Bitcoin. I got him 1 satoshi for every year he was alive! So I went to a bitcoin ATM, got the minimum amount, printed off an extra couple keys, went home and learned how to transfer it. The remainder I decided to keep for myself, as my first ever coins. Then I did was the internet suggested, generated my own wallet and swept the remainder into it (and gave .2mBtc to my partner!). This subreddit has been interesting for years, and now it turns out it's been really useful, so thank you for that, everyone!

I know it's not much, but here it is in all it's glory... MY wallet! 1PKPADd5ahbbaTE7pj9iuPtDUekTJN629m

Needless to say I'm **very excited**. I'm thinking I'll be putting a bit of my paycheck every month into it, and never converting back into fiat. If I spend any Bitcoin, it'll be at a place that accepts it (taking recommendations!). I'm pretty large in debt right now, because life, but I'm working hard at getting it down and never getting into debt again. However, I figured I can safely put about 4% of my income into my wallet every month, a bit more if I manage to finally quit smoking!

Thanks for reading, I know it's a ramble, I just had to share. I'm working on memorizing my 12 words as we speak so I can burn the paper! :)

One more thing, if anyone knows any programming projects that need to be made, please let me know. I'm happy to contribute, especially if there's anything in Go."

8rxvfz,1529310001,gta3uzi,2,9,Terrible Idea for a Bitcoin Vending Machine,"I've recently seen a lot of concepts for Bitcoin vending machines. I enjoy the novelty of these devices. They take an old concept, automating the exchange of money for a soda, or candy, and modernize it.

I can't help but think this could be expanded upon.

A lot of machines I see use a static QR code as a trigger. I thought - why not use a display to generate a unique address for every transaction? Different items at different price points could be vended in this way.

Then I thought, what if the person doesn't pay the proper amount? What if they overpay? Underpay? What if they can't pay at all?..

**That's an interesting concept. Someone who wants something out of a vending machine - yet they can't pay for it. A lot of us have been there. How terrible...**

What if this vending machine didn't sell soda and candy, but things like water, or high calorie meal replacements, or diapers, or feminine products? Necessities. What if the person who couldn't pay were legitimately needy?

Could this vending machine be fitted with a webcam? Could the needy person then appeal to someone on the other side of the webcam for funds to acquire this necessity that they need?

Who would they appeal to? An individual, or an audience? An audience on the internet?

Maybe that same, unique, payee's privacy-protecting QR code could be shown to some generous soul on the internet, one of many watching this webcam feed...

Maybe this person-in-need could appeal to this pool of anonymous, protected, endowed individuals to cover this expense. A single individual in this audience could then decide to cover this individual's expense. Maybe this pool of people would feel encouraged by a sense of helping this needy person?

Maybe the person running the machine could generate a profit from enabling this interaction?

Just a terrible idea I had for a Bitcoin Vending Machine."

The ADAMANT team has done in depth research on the available messenger systems like Telegram, WhatsApp etc before they decided to create their truly anonymous messenger. As you can see in the table below you can see the many elements that are, or should be, part of a secure anonymous user friendly messenger. The table only shows the key players, the community manager told me the left out some other big players. But if you ask him he can explain the difference between every messenger and their product. Considering the market of messengers, the segment demanding truly communicate anonymous with ease is huge!

ADAMANT &amp; Technology

ADAMANT is a fully decentralized system that is based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus (DPoS) algorithm. This choice was made in order to meet the following criteria:

● DPoS allows for any transaction to be reliably confirmed within the 5 second interval. This time is critical for fast messaging and payment execution;

● DPoS dramatically lowers the system maintenance cost — there is no need for vast computing powers and therefore — barbaric electricity waste, comparing to POW;

● Fixed transaction fees;

● Dignified system scalability and reliability factors.

Unfortunately all modern use cases of the Ethereum blockchain are not quite suitable for maintaining the ADAMANT network. This is determined by a relatively high value of “gas” (transactions’ fee), that is used for every Ethereum transaction, including all message transfers. This is why ADAMANT is built on an independent blockchain — hence the transactions’ costs could be low enough to operate the whole network and they could also be adjusted based on the future rising token price.

Moreover, Proof of Work technology in not suitable either, because its maintenance cost is high, and with the grow of participants’ amount the transactions’ fee is rising up quickly. Considering these reasons a program code of the Lisk project is being used for realization of the server part and the blockchain itself. This source code was extended in order to obtain the required functional.

The ADAMANT architecture is flexible enough for allowing us to make changes to transactions’ fee, if needed.

The fact that the team really took a in depth research in the technological base is a good sign the team is able to both think of the current requirements as well as of the features desired for the further development of its platform. Since the chosen technology and the way the product is set up the platform could be trusted/used by the whole world, which is a huge target market!

 **Silk Road** is an online black market and the first modern darknet market, best known as a platform for selling illegal drugs. As part of the [dark web](https://satoshiuncle.com/more-cryptocurrency-payments-rising-on-dark-web/), it was operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring. The website was launched in February 2011; development had begun six months prior. Initially, there were a limited number of new seller accounts available; new sellers had to purchase an account in an auction. Later, a fixed fee was charged for each new seller account.

Though not prepared but, Adamant is getting ready each an Android and an iOS cellular software that can allow us to have entry to the whole service wherever we’re.
What’s the catch?

Each message despatched by way of the service has a token value connected to it. zero.005 ADM to be exact. Personally, I believe it’s a truthful worth to pay for sending a very encrypted, safe, and untrackable message.

The token makes use of a DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) system to generate new tokens and so they have the whole scheme outlined of their whitepaper. There you may also study extra concerning the system, the brand new blockchain, and the staff behind this wonderful mission.

It’s definitely one thing new to the moment messaging market, however to be trustworthy this app just isn’t made for simply anyone. It’s made for the 1%, the those that have secrets and techniques they wish to conceal, and people which can be in want of a safe technique to talk.

I recently bought bitcoin from Coinbase, and sent it to my armoury wallet, however I didn't actually install the Bitcoin Core blockchain until after the transfer was confirmed and irreversible. 

I am now downloading the blockchain, but I have a few questions;

The first one is how can I link Bitcoin Core with Armoury? 

And secondly, even if I link the blockchain to the armoury wallet, will I have lost all my money since the wallet was not ready to take the money? Or is that not how it works at all?

Also the Armoury wallet is always in offline mode. Is this due to the blockchain not being linked to Armoury?

Finally when I am on Armoury there is nothing displayed on my dashboard, and there is only one tab called ""dashboard"". I do not see any other tabs such as ""transactions"" or ""announcements"". 

I am using Armoury v0.96, and Bitcoin Core v0.16.1.

Thank you in advance for anyone who could help me out! I'm a complete noob.

On some platforms there is a 0.2% per 24 hours negative swap for long and for short positions (the broker is taking from both positions).

Sometimes the swap is paid by short positions, sometimes by long. There are months that overall swap is near zero, but some months longs or shorts pay more (double digit percent per month!).

This makes trading Bitcoin and other crypto on margin very shitty.

Compare this with EUR/USD swap rate (0.0025262% daily positive swap for short positions, 0.00715765% negative swap daily for long positions - the rates differ on different platforms, this is just an example).

Current hashrate (Total network hashrate): 36349358,259 TH/S (From [https://blockchain.info/stats](https://blockchain.info/stats))  


We choose our miners from here:  
[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining\_hardware\_comparison](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison)  


Let's take for example: Antminer S9  
*Hashrate = 14 TH/S*  
*Consumption = 1.375 kW*  


**Cost of harwares:**  
*Hardware = Current hashrate \* Price of Antminer S9 / Hash produced by Antminer (per seconds)*  
*Hardware = 36349358,259 \* 2400$ / 14*  
*Hardware \~=  6,231,318,559 $*  


*Number of antminers = Hardware / 2400 \~= 2,596,382*  


**Cost of electricity:**  
*Electricity consumption per day = Number of antminers \* consumption \* 24*  
*Electricity consumption per day = 2,596,382 \* 1.375 \* 24*  
*Electricity consumption per day \~= 85,680,606 kWh*  


*Electricity cost per day = Electricity consumption per day \* Cost per 1kWh*  
*Electricity cost per day = 85,680,606 \* 0.045$ (*[*Electricity pricing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_pricing) *- Depend on countries)*  


So attacker have to pay 3,855,627 $ of electricity per day !  


This without make calculation of transport, renting or buying local where to install all this stuff, without counting the difficulty to get this number of miners and electricity power required to get them working all.  


And counting the risk that the attack will not be a success and many other factors ...  


If you want to know more about Difficulty and Hashrate: [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty)  


I made calculation 2 days ago from here:  
[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4429114.msg39597354#msg39597354](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4429114.msg39597354#msg39597354)  


In the space of two days, we can see this changes:  
**Hardwares:**  
Today = 6,231,318,559 $  
2Days ago = 5,936,594,032 $  


**Difference \~= 294,724,527$**  
**Additional AntMiners \~= 122,802**  


**Electricity:**  
Today = 3,855,627$  
2Days ago = 3,673,266$

8s1o1p,1529345341,HK_Leverage,0,2,Article: Forensic Accounting Challenges and Valuation Considerations - Withum 2017,"**Virtual Currency – Forensic Accounting Challenges and Valuation Considerations**

Staying competitive means obtaining and maintaining new competencies around trends that impact our clients’ day-to-day operations. The ways people exchange money for goods and services is rapidly evolving, but the same challenges around tracking payment or valuing credit arrangements remain the same.

You’ve likely heard the buzz words “virtual currency”, “digital currency” or Bitcoin more frequently as of late. This article explores forensic accounting challenges and valuation considerations related to this new form of virtual exchange.

Digital currency or digital money is an Internet-based medium of exchange distinct from physical currency (such as banknotes and coins) that exhibits properties similar to physical currencies, but allows for instantaneous transactions and borderless transfer of ownership. Bitcoin is a type of digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds operating independently of a central bank. Users have “wallets” which are anonymous, unique, account IDs that have associated with them virtual currency amounts. The virtual currency network self-regulates by giving all users a record of every transaction that has occurred between every wallet since inception.  This is meant to minimize or eliminate cheating between wallets. It is this ability to screen out “cheaters” that is encouraging global banks to adopt forms of virtual currency logic to improve security around its millions and millions of daily transactions.

Several steps are typically taken when performing a forensic investigation, including, but not limited to, reviewing legal information, financial documents and confirming or refuting allegations.  From a forensic investigation standpoint, tracing virtual currency transactions can create challenges when applying traditional forensic accounting techniques.

By definition, virtual currency is a decentralized currency. Since few banking or credit institutions (currently) deal in this type of currency, it is unlikely that bank or credit card statements exist for virtual currency transactions. A lack of documentation related to who owns the wallets and the purpose of each transaction creates traceability challenges. The existence of an unregulated, unaudited ledger begs the question of how transparent any given observable virtual ledger transaction really is. To investigate a specific transaction or set of transactions, the forensic specialist will need to not only have access to transaction information, but also have a way of mapping a wallet to a particular person or institution. Additionally, the investigator will likely require skilled information technology specialists to sift through the reams of data.  

Tracing wallet transactions becomes more like tracing cash movement than like tracing traditional electronic payment systems. In fact, the most reliable measure of virtual currency activity may only be the observed funding of the wallet and any transfers out of the wallet to a traditional currency account. 

Another consideration from a forensic accounting perspective is verifying if a transaction happened through a third party. While banks and credit card companies can be subpoenaed when dealing with traditional fiat currencies, the same does not hold true for virtual currencies. In a traditional setting, the forensic specialist can usually hold interviews with parties or subpoena the bank for account holder IDs. With virtual currencies, how does one determine if multiple wallets are actually held by non-exist persons or entities? 

The reality is that while the proponents of virtual currency laud its open framework, the anonymous nature of wallet transactions and lack of independently audited information makes tracing individual activity a challenge. 

Valuation professionals face similar challenges around data verification when valuing virtual currency loans. If the two components of any valuation are a calculated benefit stream and an estimated risk of not receiving the benefit, then virtual currency loans can be of varying degrees of risk depending on how they are structured. The virtual currency lender can see the balance of the virtual currency borrower’s wallet at all times; in essence, allowing it to monitor the borrower’s account activity. However this offers little recourse to the lender and only conditions and terms outside the virtual framework, like in traditional lending, can truly be enforced. Lastly, virtual currency fluctuations make market uncertainty a major factor to consider. Therefore, valuing a virtual currency credit agreement should look a lot like the valuation of an unsecured, risky foreign currency loan.

Forensic accounting and valuation matters related to virtual currency can be performed using the tools we use for traditional assets and liabilities. Practitioner’s can gain a foothold on this leading edge of finance as long as they are willing to handle the high degree of uncertainty and limited information available around transactions in this space."

They've been extremely useful as a temporary measure to allow people to get involved, but allowing companies to have control over your private keys for any amount of time is not useful in the long term. I found bisq today and it seems like an ideal alternative, so I thought I'd try to spread the word.

The title of this post pretty much sums ot up, but it's a well deisgned open source desktop client for buying and selling any coins directly between people, with independent anonymous arbitrators. You can store and encrypt all of your wallets locally, and your coin/identity/IP is never stored on any centralized server. 

I thought this was all pretty impressive, and it seems to me to be the best path forward in terms of long term usage, storage, and freedom of control over your money.

An Indian court declared former Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Nalin Kotadiya a proclaimed offender in connection with a Bitcoin (BTC) extortion case amounting to $1.3 million, Business Standard

Judge PG Tamakuwala declared Kotadiya a proclaimed offender or “absconder” under Section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with reference to an application filed by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Kotadiya “remained untraceable,” even after a warrant was issued for his arrest. The CID initatiated proceedings again, seeking that the court should declare him a proclaimed offender.

In India, a [proclaimed offender proceeding](http://legodesk.com/blog/mean-proclaimed-offender/) is a procedure of the court, by which the court announces the individual as a wrongdoer and compels police to apprehend the individual named in the procedure. The passport of the wrongdoer is also confiscated so that they may not flee the country. The ruling ordered Kotadiya to appear before the court within 30 days.

Now many people who bought Bitcoin years ago find themselves sitting on an untouchable bounty，though it fluctuates every now and then，those lucky guys who purchased or mined just a few bitcoins at the early era of cryptocurrency nowadays still can boast about their savings happily. However, some of them now are in a painful limbo，because they can't remember the complex security passwords needed to get to their wallet. Everyone has a hard luck story about losing their Bitcoins. Whether it be throwing out an old computer or suffering a hack, nothing compares to the most frustrating situation of all —you have your wallet but you can't remember your password and you still don’t know how to recover bitcoin password. Unlike a bank, bitcoin has no central hotline to call for reset. This is really a bad thing，it's like forgetting a bank account password, but there's no bank to call to reset it. The money is lost forever. That might be a lot of money at today’s exchange rate.
Read a fantastic story recently about people who forgot passwords and are resorting to hypnosis, maybe sometimes it works but it's not scientific，lately the world of cryptocurrency was touched by two stories，one of them has a happy ending but another one isn’t so fortunate.
Did you lose your wallet password without any clue of what it might have been? Then it will be very difficult for anybody in the world help you to retrieve wallet password. No one, neither a Russian Hacker nor MI6, or the FBI can be able to crack that password to your crypto wallet. Mostly you know what the password should have been but maybe you are one character off or the capitalization is off, these common mistakes are the most likely reason that you are locked out of your wallet，and if there’s slightest chance you do remember parts of your password, or origin of it，then it’s a very big chance we can help you to retrieve your bitcoin password. 

     For those wallet holders who have forgotten their passwords, all may not be as bad as it seems. Hopefully BitcoinRecovery can help you to recover bitcoin password, it’s compatible with encrypted wallet documents of cryptocurrency including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other branching digital currencies which based on bitcoin or ethereum structure.

BitcoinRecovery is an advanced and extremely fast passwords recovery tool for encrypted bitcoin/ethereum wallets，we have created a highly optimized multi-threaded program to perform the brute-force decryption. It can set multiple arithmetic rules to crack the password in case of uncertainty. The software supports multi-threading processes and takes full advantage of multiple CPU/GPU layouts and it can ensure the program makes good use of all the available system resources. Its operation including comprehensive combination of passwords, covering all possible elements in a password (upper/lower cases, numbers / special symbols) to avoid missing out any character.
You need to generate a list of potential password phrases based on your best guess for password，and decryption is based on the rules you set up，the computer will combine all the characters you selected in a certain order，then it can create a highly optimized multi-threaded program to perform the brute-force decryption until it succeeds，the better the computer's CPU/GPU（with as many cores as possible），the faster the decryption.
One particular thing to note, this software is running locally, it doesn’t upload any of customers’ information, users can disconnect the network link to run the decryption process to recover bitcoin password, and their wallet security will be safe，without giving any people any chance to steal their money, so that we can protect our customers’confidentiality.
BitcoinRecovery works with Windows 10, 8, 7 and Mac. It's also available in a portable form for both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows, so it doesn't require installation.

8s82u9,1529407433,crypt0b0b,0,1,Coinigy hangs in Chrome,"I've had an subscription to Coinigy for almost a year now, but some time this year it started to hang up when i try to change timeframe og change currency. I've tried to contact their customer service and they asked if i could disable all my plugins - which i have tried (even though i need at least two of them) but it didn't change anything. They finally asked me to ""please try guest mode"" whatever that means, and i asked ""do Coinigy have a guest mode?"", to which they replied:

I'm afraid we do not have a guest mode. What we do have, however, is a 30-day trial that you can use for a month which includes most of the features that are available with a full subscription.

I hope this helps
Best Regards,

So, apparently i won't get any help from them - it actually seems they have forgot what the case is all about and that i actually have an active subscription :D

Chrome is my preferred browser, but still i tried Internet Explorer just to see if it made any difference, and the hang up problem disappeared but now the price levels on the price axis disappeared, as well as the levels on the fib tool and several of the items in the menus above. 

Have anyone else had a problem with this, using Chrome?

""Although the whole the cryptocurrency global market capitalization has seen somewhat of a downturn since its peak of over $1 Trillion Australian Dollars on January 8th, there’s one sector of the cryptocurrency space in Australia that shows no sign of slowing down; Bitcoin ATM machines.  

The first Bitcoin ATM installed in Australia was installed in 2014 in Pitt St Mall, Sydney, and up until the end of 2017, only 20 more had been installed across the country. However, according to Australian Bitcoin ATM locator site [FindBitcoinATM](https://www.findbitcoinatm.com.au), that number has more than doubled in the first half of 2018 alone – with a further 24 being installed.""  

Pretty amazing - there's still not one near me dammit!

8s83fa,1529407595,constantin_md,4,0,Reasons for supporting and keeping bitcoin,"Hodl, statistically people who invested and never sold made more money than those who tried to trade often.  
Moon, it happened before and there is a big chance it will happen again, have patience and you will be rewarded.  
Lambo, i don't know about that, but at least a nice, fresh from the dealership Lexus, Mercedes, Audi or BMW will do just fine.
Venezuela, is a good example what can happen to fiat. There is a possibility that Banks or governments can null your savings.   
Crypto is future of money, a decentrilized currency without borders seems to be the best bet.
Fiat and banks will crash one day, power to the people!  
Be your own bank, banks won't have power over your savings and your funds will never be freezed.  
1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin, the fiat price doesn't matter in the long run. You will gain a lot more than you can imagine as soon as institutional money pour in.  
You don't lose if you don't sell, historically only those who sold and didn't have patience to hodl, lost.   
Zoom out the chart, you should do this all the time whenever you feel like selling out of fear.  
I'm buying more bitcoin all the time when the price goes down, that way i gain a lot more when the price goes up. Think about it as a limited time discount.  
Feel free to add more reasons. "

Most of it no longer needs to be printed; the bankers merely type numbers into their bank computers and steal wealth from the rest of us.

Gold cannot be created from thin air by merely typing numbers into a computer.  Gold has the seven necessary properties to be considered ""good money"": Durable, divisible, portable, recognizable, fungible, **rare, and difficult to counterfeit**.  These properties only apply to real, physical gold.  Beware of gold-coated tungsten.

Bitcoin also shares the seven properties, making it a form of ""good money"".  Bitcoin is rare and extremely difficult to counterfeit.  Bitcoin has other properties which, for many people, make it even better than gold.

Throughout history, gold has remained precious, while fiat currencies eventually collapse.  Today's fiat currencies aren't looking so healthy, by the way - and this is why I remain long-term bullish on Bitcoin."

The following are not my words, link will be included at the end of this post.

Whether it is gold', stocks, or crypto currencies, if you are a stacker with the intent to build a portfolio of assets over a period of years, pullbacks in markets are a time to buy. How many of you save your money to go shopping on Black Friday? When the grocery store has a sale on your favorite cereal do you think “hmmm I’ll wait and see if it’s lower next week” ? We get excited when we see a television or laptop go on sale and we do not hesitate to buy. Unfortunately when it comes to investing, for some reason, most want to pay higher prices? This is where many investors, simply get it wrong. 

In 1997 Warren Buffet’s letter to shareholders included a short quiz. 

Question: 
Q1. If you plan to eat hamburgers throughout your life and are not a cattle producer, should you wish for higher or lower prices for beef? 
Q2. Likewise, if you are going to buy a car from time to time but are not an auto manufacturer, should you prefer higher or lower car prices? 
These questions, of course, answer themselves. 
Q3. But now for the final exam: If you expect to be a net saver during the next five years, should you hope for a higher or lower stock market during that period? 

Answer: 
Many investors get this one wrong. Even though they are going to be net buyers of stocks for many years to come, they are elated when stock prices rise and depressed when they fall. In effect, they rejoice because prices have risen for the “hamburgers” they will soon be buying. This reaction makes no sense. Only those who will be sellers of equities in the near future should be happy at seeing stocks rise. Prospective purchasers should much prefer sinking prices. 

Warren simply nailed it. If you are in accumulation mode of assets, why would you want the price to move higher? You should be happy it is moving lower allowing you to accumulate more. I can tell you from experience as a long time metals stacker, you can never have enough metals when the price starts to run. I remember when silver' hit $17 in 2007 and I thought to myself, “boy I wish I would have bought more”. That was truly the first time it hit me that I should not be wasting my money on cars and crap, but on building my asset base. If you believe that in three, five or 10 years down the road Bitcoin' will be much higher than today, then why would you not add if you have the means to? If you think Bitcoin' is a fad, or bubble then you simply should not be speculating.

I know Bitcoin began with cypherpunks and libertarians. Both of those political leanings are more fringe politics, not as mainstream. 

I know after that, conservative (Republican) supporters entered the space, and that it has also been appealing to some liberals (Democrats). 

So now my questions:

1) What are your personal political leanings as related to Bitcoin?

2) In what way do you think Bitcoin affects politics that you disagree with (good or bad)?

3) Do you think the Bitcoin space is ready for true mainstream Bitcoiners who won’t share your political views but will (try to) find a way for Bitcoin to fit into theirs?

4) Please recommend any articles / books that you have read and liked on any of these topics. 

I recommend this as a [critical but interesting Bitcoin article](https://www.salon.com/2018/06/08/how-bitcoin-made-right-wing-conspiracy-theories-mainstream/) about conservative conspiracy theories entering the space.

Cheers - I hope and ask for this thread to remain respectful and kept in line with a ‘this is my perspective’ take. "

8sej6s,1529460023,ElephantGlue,4,4,Is volatility the correct term?,"Bitcoin had a meteoric rise from around 1k to nearly 20k in December. When investors talk about bitcoin now, they mention the risk is in the volatility. 

Two counter points come to mind for me:

1.	 Should we measure volatility in dollars instead of measuring volatility in terms of contribution to the network, ie - hash rate? If we talk about the intrinsic value of bitcoin being based upon Metcalfes law, it would make sense that the volatility in value should be measured against the users of the network, and those users who stand to lose the most (miners) are increasing exponentially.
2.	 The value in dollars has been stabilizing since December towards the 6 thousand dollar mark. This signifies a trend for decreased fiat volatility within this timeframe.

I think that these two points highlight the fact that the most important people in the bitcoin ecosystem are more bullish than ever, the network is more secure than ever, and the volatility against the dollar is the lowest it has been in probably the last 20% of bitcoins lifetime.

Thanks for reading."

Scientists found that the behavior of bird's ""Murmuration"" is a abvious application of blockchain. That means blockchain has already existed in the world long long ago.

Bird's ""Murmuration"" has no actual leader, but some of species can change more than 25 ways to fly in the ""Murmuration"". That's amazing!! Millions of birds fly together in a high speed and will not crash others.

""Murmuration"" shows a sign of Blockchain-ship. The whole bird group likes a blochchain, every bird is the node of this blockchain, they share info together and act consistently. Those birds trust each other so that they don't need a leader(intermediary) to lead how to fly, they fly efficiently through the perfect collaboration."

I've been wondering if I could get a bitcoin wallet, and put (for example, $50 worth of bitcoin in it) and use that to buy stuff online?

It's because of my inability to use PayPal 
all the time as it belongs to my friend, and I do not have one because I do not have a credit/debit card, so I was wondering if there was like a 3rd party that would take my BTC and turn that into regular dollars and redirect them to the site? 

I'm mostly wanting to spend on sites like Azure, and DigitalOcean for servers that power my website,
but I can't just keep asking my friend to use his PayPal and pay him back in cash every month.

Are there any services that do that? or maybe other ways to accomplish what I need?

PS: I'm relatively new to Bitcoin, having only heard about it, I never used it before this time, so I apologise if I said something wrong or incorrect, or just misunderstood how Bitcoin works.

Thanks!"

e.g I am using is 

https://blockchain.info/tx/f91e7976cb46d5e65033d33a97f7bcc0ac3d444d8e01bba97077550c32e5270e

One of the articles I am using to try to understand was:

https://techtake.info/2017/08/22/segwit-bitcoincash-technical-details-explained/

This article says the new structure of a TX is:

Serialization format for transaction with SegWit:
Field Size	Name	Type	Description
4	version	int32_t	Transaction data format version
1	marker	char	Must be zero
1	flag	char	Must be nonzero
1+	txin_count	var_int	Number of transaction inputs
41+	txins	txin[]	A list of one or more transaction inputs
1+	txout_count	var_int	Number of transaction outputs
9+	txouts	txouts[]	A list of one or more transaction outputs
1+	script_witnesses	script_witnesses[]	The witness structure as a serialized byte array
4	lock_time	uint32_t	The block number or timestamp until which the transaction is locked

Now the script witness consists of:

Double SHA256 of the serialization of:
1. nVersion of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
2. hashPrevouts (32-byte hash)
3. hashSequence (32-byte hash)
4. outpoint (32-byte hash + 4-byte little endian)
5. scriptCode of the input (serialized as scripts inside CTxOuts)
6. value of the output spent by this input (8-byte little endian)
7. nSequence of the input (4-byte little endian)
8. hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
9. nLocktime of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
10. sighash type of the signature (4-byte little endian)

Now when I look at:

https://blockchain.info/tx/f91e7976cb46d5e65033d33a97f7bcc0ac3d444d8e01bba97077550c32e5270e


Input scripts:

ScriptSig: PUSHDATA(22)[0014c6d9370d4ba53b3f07ff918fffd277a44fc1bca5] 
Witness: 02483045022100b8787c50f69bfd68a396161cb5cbc7996efbc04367e4355ff2211ba9fa6f1f5a02207171a33bc8cb0dcd54e51daacf168f6d4f9bf3998e918f1c195bd7f16d0c2867012102c31aab1a32fd115ce7a3f2edce54d86f0c36f4c946345926374ff7dee5e6a23e


Output scripts:

DUP HASH160 PUSHDATA(20)[caad1c0359b179cb13a4abd386d65846f0ed49db] EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG
0[] PUSHDATA(20)[b1596d2a53c9f86da51946ec21705f3a9bb0e6b8]


The input script sig (ScriptSig: PUSHDATA(22)[0014c6d9370d4ba53b3f07ff918fffd277a44fc1bca5] ) used to be part of the input in pre segwit. But there is no ""script sig"" in segwit, so if this part of the ""script witness""?

And ""DUP HASH160 PUSHDATA(20)[caad1c0359b179cb13a4abd386d65846f0ed49db] EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG
0[] PUSHDATA(20)[b1596d2a53c9f86da51946ec21705f3a9bb0e6b8]""

used to be the output script that is pushed onto the stack. Is this a part of the ""Script witness"" too?

Also, if I have two inputs, will I have two script witnesses? (because pre segwit each input had its own script, and each output had a pubKey script)

Also, this is a segwit tx. Is there any change in which a block is structured under segwit? If yes, any good doc I ca go over to understand that?

I know these are a lot of questions. Sorry.

Here is an example of why a ""national"" cryptocurrency can not succeed with such mentality in Turkey.

One thing that bothers me is the need for custodians (banks, ie coinbase etc).

Bitcoin is too complex for the every day person to manage and because of this, we will always need a custodian to “safe guard” it.

Hypothetically speaking, let’s say the world adopts bitcoin as its store of value.

What is to say that governments won’t make bitcoin withdrawals from a bank like coinbase illegal and instead they issue promissory notes (fiat).

8si7ir,1529500564,corsicanainvestor,0,4,Bitcoin Theft From Calling Scam Ledger Wallet Customer Support Number On Google Search Engine,"         I'm posting this to warn others about dangers on the Internet.  I had about two-thirds of all my investments in Bitcoin.  I was unaware of all the scammers on the Internet until one stole the Bitcoins from my Coinbase account.  Ledger Wallet imposed a mandatory upgrade to their hardware wallet for cryptocurrencies.  When I was following the online instructions, I was locked out of MyEtherWallet with 'Error Code 5' and didn't find the instructions on how to get around this until April 1st.  They were on the MyEtherWallet website and I could go on my account after following those instructions to find my ERC20 tokens.  
         Be aware that Ledger Wallet in Paris, France has no telephone support anywhere in the world.  All the listings for toll-free numbers listed on Google and other search engines are to scammers.  The following warning was posted on the Ledger Wallet Twitter Timeline March 1st, but I didn't notice it until after the theft of my Bitcoins on 3-8-18.  There is no such warning on the Ledger Wallet website which would have prevented me from falling for this scam.  

[**Ledger**‏Verified account @**LedgerHQ**](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ)📷 [Mar 1](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ/status/969171921916121088)

WARNING: Ledger does NOT provide customer support over the phone. Beware the scammers impersonating the Ledger support team by using 1-888-XXXX (or others) phone numbers. Don’t give control of your computer to strangers and NEVER reveal your 24 words to anyone!

Never search for customer support numbers on search engines.  These are unverified listings.  If a company lists no telephone support numbers on its real website, it means they have no telephone support and they are not required to with cryptocurrencies.  Numerous customer support scams have telephone numbers which show up on search engines.  You should never call these numbers as you will be in contact with criminals.  You can type the number itself into the search bar and will often find numerous listings as the same number is being used to impersonate customer service for more than one company.  The scammer I called wanted to remote access my computer and I allowed him to do this as I thought he worked for Ledger Wallet without knowing Google doesn't verify the telephone numbers which appear on their search engines.  It showed up on the screen that several bugs were found on the computer which needed to be removed.  The scammer said my Bitcoins needed to be moved off my Ledger Bitcoin Wallet for my own security while he was removing the bugs he pretended to have found.  He suggested I move them onto Coinbase which I did.  When he was done with his pretend computer servicing, he said I should stay off the computer for the next twelve hours.  The next morning I went onto the Coinbase account and found the Bitcoins were gone.  They had been sent to anonymous Bitcoin addresses and could not be recovered.

I reported this sad story to the Palm Beach Research Group.  Their online educational materials introduced me to cryptocurrency investing, but they haven't included enough warnings for novice investors.  I received this message in response, but have omitted names as I don't have permission to post them.

I'm part of     's team and I help manage his editorial content and social media presence. We're very sorry to hear about your situation.      read your notes and passed them along directly to        . The team also passed along your notes to Palm Beach Research Group's Customer Service division. Even though what you went through is awful, we're grateful to you for sharing your experience with us; right now, we're doing exactly as you advised: looking into providing additional warnings, advice, and how-to guides for spotting and avoiding the more insidious and subtle scams that are out there. That content should be coming out soon, I am told. Again, what happened to you was horrible, but with any luck we'll be able to help prevent something like that from happening to other subscribers. Thank you.

It's gratifying to know others will benefit  from my mistakes, but I haven't found anyone who wants to restore the Bitcoins I lost.  I will provide my new Trezor Wallet Bitcoin address which has a zero balance at the time of this posting.  I would deeply appreciate any donations to help restore the 5.45130674 Bitcoins I had on my Ledger Wallet prior to the theft.  Please only donate if you are wealthy and have Bitcoins to spare as I will consider any Bitcoin I receive a gift.  It would help me survive this dreadful ordeal to recover the funds I lost and know I prevented others from losing much larger sums.  Feel free to pass this post on to anyone you know who owns Bitcoin.  Any donation will help.

3Hq4YJu9wfr8mLbx9ePQc79nKfN7mMUoex

I have verified this address is the same one which appears on the screen of my Trezor hardware wallet and my computer screen.  It's important to make sure these addresses are the same when you receive funds.  The address above can only receive Bitcoin.  You can test this address by sending a tiny amount of Bitcoin and private message corsicanainvestor on reddit.  I will reply as soon as I see the message to verify the amount received and validate this Bitcoin address.  Please only send a large amount after I respond to your message to be safe.

Here's part of a message I received from customer service at MyEtherWallet.  It contains important warnings about how to avoid dangers on the Internet.

I'm sorry for all you've been through. It seems that those funds may just be lost forever, but I can't help but hold onto hope that maybe you'll get some sort of reimbursement for all the trouble and heartache you've had. I really do wish you the best in all of this. Whenever you are curious about anything, feel free to reach out to me and I'd be happy to try and point you in the right directions, for future reference. This crypto world is lacking in decent support, so we at MEW try to help anyone who needs questions answered, even if it is beyond our actual range of job coverage. Whatever information I have on security, I'm happy to help.

The phishers and scammers are on the loose! Protect yourself by installing [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn) or [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) or [Cryptonite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige). Never enter your private information on ANY website without verifying it is the correct website. If you give them your private key, they can &amp; will steal ALL YOUR COINS.  - MyEtherWallet

I have added  the above mentioned Google Chrome extensions to my Google Chrome browser to protect myself from phishing websites.  They look very similar to the websites created by legitimate companies, but are run by criminals who want to trick you into providing private information so they can steal your funds.  EAL stands for EtherAddressLookup and can be found on the Google search engine in the Chrome Web Store.  MetaMask and Cryptonite by MetaCert can also be found on the Google search engine in the Chrome Web Store and I have all three.

Here's a list of more warnings I've come up with while learning about cryptocurrency theft.  It's important to warn others about Internet dangers to prevent scams.  These warnings came at a high price to me, but I want others to benefit from my mistakes.  I hope and pray my Bitcoins will be restored through donations from grateful readers.

1. Only call a number for customer service listed on a company's real website.  Never trust listings from search engines and be certain you are on the real website and not a phishing site.  The Google Chrome extensions you need to avoid them are mentioned in the conversation I had with a customer service representative at MyEtherWallet.
2. Never allow anyone you don't trust to have your private keys to MyEtherWallet or anywhere else your funds are kept as they can and will steal all your funds.
3. Never allow a stranger to remote access your computer even if a listing on the Internet appears legitimate.  This is something scammers want to do so they can come back later to steal your funds.
4. Be aware there are multiple ways the professional thieves have devised to steal your funds.  Never trust an email is from who it appears to be from.  If there is personal account information requested, never provide it.  It's very dangerous to click on links in suspicious emails.  You could be downloading malware or visiting a phishing site.
5. Never trust a caller on the telephone is who they claim to be.  Anyone who claims to work for a legitimate company and asks for sensitive personal information is likely wanting to steal from you and will tell you a pack of lies to put you in an urgent state of mind.
6. Never reveal your 24 word phrase to a cryptocurrency wallet to anyone.  Keep a record of it offline where you know it's safe and never take a photograph of it or put it into an email.  Those 24 words could be used to clone your wallet and steal your funds.
7. Trezor Wallet is recommended over Ledger Wallet as many Ledger Wallet customers have had unresolved issues due to a mandatory upgrade.  This presumed upgrade caused me to lose all my Bitcoins which could have been prevented if the March 1st Twitter Warning had been posted on the Ledger Wallet website.  Even after reporting this theft to the Ledger Wallet online support people, there is still no warning on the Ledger Wallet website regarding their telephone impersonators.  This was a negligent omission as this could have been copied and pasted from the Twitter Timeline March 1st and spared me this nightmare.  A warning about a security threat should not be reserved for the Ledger Wallet Twitter followers.
8. Avoid using cryptocurrencies to make purchases online as the transactions are irreversible and you cannot dispute the charges as you can with a credit card.
9. Always be wary on the Internet and never take posts at face value.  They may not have been made by the people they are pretending to be and thieves will try any trick you can imagine and some you would never have imagined.  The Internet is a dangerous place filled with scam artists.
10. If a company has no telephone support number to call listed on their real website, it means they don't have telephone support.  Do not look up these numbers on search engines as this is how you will come in contact with criminals who want to steal your funds.
11. Never use a hardware wallet which has already been initialized and never order one advertised as being used.  People have lost their life savings by purchasing Ledger Wallets on ebay which have scratch off cards to reveal their 24 word phrase.  This was not packaged that way by the manufacturer.  It was tampered with and repackaged by someone who wants to steal your funds.
12. Beware of scams around every corner of the Internet and never take postings at face value.  They could be made by criminals impersonating real customer support people you cannot call on the telephone or expect them to make any response to your online support requests on their own website.  It's a sad world of thieves and scammers on the Internet and it's easy to fall into their traps.  The lack of decent customer service in the cryptocurrency sphere has created a dangerous place for anyone who hasn't been warned about the extent that Internet thieves will trick and deceive their victims into thinking they want to help solve problems the company they pretend to represent cannot solve for you as they have no real telephone customer service and their online customer service is so poor that many see their requests for assistance never responded to.

FEEL FREE TO SHARE THIS ENTIRE POST ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND YOUTUBE.  YOU CAN COPY AND PASTE THE TEXT OR USE A LINK TO CORSICANAINVESTOR ON REDDIT WITH YOUR OWN DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I'VE POSTED.  MANY OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS I USED TO WATCH BEFORE THE INCIDENT HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART, BUT I NO LONGER WATCH THEM AS IT'S TOO PAINFUL TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF BITCOIN SINCE MINE WERE STOLEN.  I'VE OFTEN WISHED I COULD GET BACK THAT DAY AND DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY AS I ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN WITH MY OWN POOR JUDGMENT, BUT THIS PERSONAL TRAGEDY CAN TURN INTO SOMETHING GOOD WITH YOUR HELP.  SHARING THIS POST ANYWHERE YOU THINK PEOPLE WOULD HAVE INTEREST IN IT WOULD HELP GET THESE WARNINGS OUT TO A LARGE AUDIENCE.  I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE'S ENOUGH WEALTH IN THE CRYPTOSPHERE THAT SOME WEALTHY BITCOIN HOLDERS WOULD BE GLAD TO COVER MY LOSSES IN EXCHANGE FOR MY GOOD ADVICE ON WHAT TO DO TO PROTECT YOUR CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND OTHER FUNDS.  PLEASE DON'T FORGET BIG NAMES SUCH AS VITALIK BUTERIN AND ROGER VER WHO BOTH HAVE A VERY LARGE FOLLOWING ON TWITTER.  THERE MAY BE PEOPLE WITH LARGER FOLLOWINGS WHOSE NAMES I'M LESS FAMILIAR WITH, BUT I WILL LEAVE IT TO MY REDDIT READERS TO SEE THAT THESE IMPORTANT WARNINGS ARE SHARED WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.  IF EVERYONE KNEW BETTER THAN TO FALL FOR THESE SCAMS, THEY WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO GO ON FOR YEARS."

In a prison, there are no currencies. No one has access to money of any kind. But a prison, although small, is still a society. And a society needs to trade goods and services. Maybe someone is a barber. This person will cut people’s hair but wants something in return. Something that he can use to later go to his cellmate and give him in return for the book that he wants from him. The cellmate also needs something in return for the book to use for getting himself another book.

How do you do this without money?

Well, they use cigarettes as a currency. A hair cut is worth 20 packs. A chance to play basketball is worth 10 packs. A book is worth 5 packs and so on. There is a problem. There are not enough cigarettes inside the prison in each person’s hands to be able to do all the transactions. But everyone knows that once a week a new supply comes in. So instead of getting the packs from each other, they start “owing” each other some packs of cigarettes. Joey gets a haircut and he owes the barber 20 packs. The barber gets a book and owes John 5 packs. Once the new shipment comes in, everyone will settle their debts.

But how do we keep track of all this?

Well, everyone will have to carry a notebook with them. Whenever two people make a transaction, they both write it down in their books. Luke writes “I owe Johnny two packs” and Johnny writes “Luke owes me two packs”. This way we know who owes what to whom. But we all write everything in the same format. One transaction after another. So it becomes a long chain of transactions. If I know how many cigarettes I had at any point and go through the transactions after it, I can figure out how many cigarettes I will have.

Last problem: how do we know what people wrote in their books are correct and no one is faking transactions? I can go steal someones book and write a fake transaction in it.

Well, to overcome this we assign the wisest most trustworthy person in the prison as a witness. Whenever two people are making a transaction, he has to witness it and sign both books with his own signature. This way, we know that each transaction is witnessed by our trusted person and actually happened.

Cigarettes are bitcoin. Notebooks are ledgers. The agreed upon text format in the notebooks is blockchain. The wise persons are bitcoin miners.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

While many of us are strong supporters of Bitcoin (and other aspects of blockchain) – there are still some key concepts that we don't fully ""grasp""

&amp;nbsp;

If you understand these concepts, however, I am certain that your love for Bitcoin will increase – **and so shall your conviction to hold through market downtrends** ;)

&amp;nbsp;

That being said – I know it's not easy to wrap your head around some of the stuff. So I've written SUPER SIMPLE analogies to help you!

&amp;nbsp;

A few weeks ago I wrote one on the Proof Of Work Puzzle

Today, I wrote an analogy on an equally important but often under-discussed topic: **The Longest Chain Rule**


&amp;nbsp;

If you understand The Longest Chain Rule it will help you with other concepts as well (Like 51% Attack, Double spends etc)  So I wrote an analogy to explain the meat of it – **A Farmer Analogy**

&amp;nbsp;

(Expert reader beware – I kept it super simple ;) )

&amp;nbsp;

**[Formatted &amp; Readable Orignal Post](http://www.mangoresearch.co/understanding-longest-chain-rule/)**

&amp;nbsp;


-----------------

# Longest Chain Explained  - A Farmer's Analogy

Let’s pretend we’re all farmers living in a small town. Majority of us farm rice as our major source of income. Weharvest the rice and pack them into 1KG gunny sacks and then carry the sacks to the Townhall. The sacks are then placed onto the only carriage the town has and transported to The Main City and sold.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

####**The Town Hall Meeting:** One day a Town Hall meeting is called to discuss the size of the gunny sacks...

&gt;An angry debate ensues on whether or not they should increase the size of each gunny-sack. Some farmers want the increased gunny-sack size for increased profits. But other farmers are against the idea – and claim it will make it more difficult for the older/younger/weaker farmers to carry the gunnysack to the Townhall.


&amp;nbsp;


####The Mayor suggests that a **vote** should be conducted to solve the matter. However, an objection is raised:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;“How is that fair? I do more work than these guys. I harvest far more rice. My vote should count more”

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


####**The Vote:** That’s when a farmer named Satoshi comes up with an idea. He suggested that the next time they come to the town hall – they vote with their gunny-sacks of rice.

&gt;Each gunny-sack would represent a vote. That way, if you have more gunny-sacks you can cast more votes.Each sack of rice would be proof of their hard work. Farmers who worked harder, had more rice – and hence got to cast more votes 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

####**The Result:** Everyone loved the idea. The next day, two rows were laid out near the Town Hall. The first row represented _“Increase Gunny Sack Size”_ and the second row represented _“Don't Increase Gunny Sack Size”_

&gt;Farmers would carry their gunny sacks to the town hall and place each sack in one of the two rows – thus casting their vote.   The row that had the longer chain of gunny sacks would be picked as the final decision. At the end of the day, the **_“Don't Increase Gunny Sack Size”_** row had the longer chain of gunny sacks – and thus was the winner!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


Disagreements within a blockchain are pretty much solved the same way. Each gunnysack represents a “block” in the blockchain.  A row of gunny sacks represents a chain.

&amp;nbsp;

Whenever there’s a disagreement, network participants can “fork” off the current chain. Thereby starting a new chain of blocks. Participants who agree with this new chain can now start applying their “blocks” to the new chain as well. Eventually, if the new chain extends the old chain – the Longest Chain Rule will kick in and will be declared the winning chain.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#Longest Chain &amp; “Work”

In our analogy, farmers were adding sacks of rice to “vote”. These sacks of rice are tangible and represent work done. The longest row of sacks represents the majority.

&amp;nbsp;

Similarly, in the blockchain, miners add a block to the chain to cast their vote. And the longest chain of blocks represent the majority. Miners on the network compete against each other by attempting to solve a puzzle – in order to win the “right” to add the next block onto the chain. 

&amp;nbsp;

A miner consumes a lot of electricity to solve these puzzles. But each time he wins (i.e solve it before someone else does)  – his block gets added to the chain.

&amp;nbsp;

##But - How does a “digital” block represent something tangible/work? 
&gt;In a way, the miner has permanently applied his electricity onto the block he just created. Since he won the solved the cryptographic puzzle, his block (with his ‘electricity’) gets added to the chain. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#So now you could say...

The farmers ‘proof of work’ was his sack of rice – and hence got to vote. After all the farmers place their sacks of rice in each of the two rows, we have our decision because: 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;​“The longest row of sacks represents where the majority farmers have placed their vote”

&amp;nbsp;

The miner’s proof of work is his winning “block” of transactions - since each block represents a miner’s electricity consumed – the entire chain represents the consumed electricity of all the previous winning blocks.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;“The longest chain of blocks represents where the majority miners have placed their vote""

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#Concluding Thoughts - Longest Chain &amp; Immutability

Remember, energy is never destroyed – simply transferred. In the proof of work, you could say that the energy is transferred to secure the blockchain.

&amp;nbsp;

Why ‘secure’? Because to change a block, you’ll have to redo the “work” that was needed to create that block.

&amp;nbsp;

To undo any of the previous blocks, you’ll have to redo the work for that block and every block that followed it. I’ll explain (in detail) why in another post. But this is what gives Bitcoin it’s strong immutability.

&amp;nbsp;

In essence, an attacker will have to start a new chain and do enough work to also become the longest chain. If and only if  his chain is the longest chain will it be considered the winner and valid. And you may understand now – to achieve this, would require consuming a lot of electricity. This is why The Longest Chain rule is so crucial to understand

8skt5c,1529520049,BELORUSIA,2,0,I just released a pay with Bitcoin EP,"So I've been trying this in various guises since 2014 - getting people to pay for music with Bitcoin.  My thinking has always been that people are averse to paying for digital music as it doesn't really have any value.  And by that I mean when you bought a CD or a vinyl, you were actually buying *something* and it feels natural to exchange something with weight (fiat) for something else with weight (a physical copy).  


It's not very sophisticated at the moment.  Literally each track's name is a BTC address (which actually fits perfectly with the dark, droning ambient music I make) and the idea would be that if you send a few satoshi's I'll send on a high quality audio file.  


It's a bit of a faff at the moment as it means someone sending me the BTC, then letting me know with a txid so I can match it up and then me emailing the track to them.  If anyone has thoughts on a more elegant way this could be achieved I'd love to hear.

8smdex,1529531696,braintertainment,35,12,A lesson from my younger self about investing,"I was just playing around with this thought and I know it might make sense for that somebody that used to be like my younger self. Hopefully preventing them from doing something they might regret in the future.   
 

When I was around 19 or 20 years old and invested in my first stock I remember being to anxious to wait. I did understand that you had to wait, but in my mind the waiting would be around 2-6 months. If after all those months I saw no big difference in the stocks I would sell them and often times at a loss.   
 

I still hadn’t mastered the patient part.   
 

Years later I looked back at most of the stocks I invested in and in a lot of cases I should of just waited.   
 

If I could tell my younger self anything I would tell the fucker to be patient. Just like a tree, it takes time for things to grow but once it stands tall, it will stand for a long time.   
 

There’s a high probability that the blockchain will exist and evolve for the next couple of years/decades. You know how I know that? Because it’s been happening for the last couple of years.  
 

Research good companies and try to look at it with a long term perspective. What market could they dominate, do they have a working product, who’s in their team, etc.  
 

Reddit, google, facebook and others didn’t become the giants overnight. It took time, hard work and patience. A shitload of patience!   
 

The younger you start investing, the sooner you’ll stop gambling  
 

Feel free to give any feedback on the thought!

8smgyy,1529532485,bidglide,0,0,Will **Cryptocurrency Futures** become more accessible in the near future + can we expect U.S. based crypto exchanges to flourish?,"This post is not meant to provide education to those interested in potentially taking advantage of the ability to trade derivatives (in this case mainly outright futures), not to discuss whether crypto derivatives are good/bad for the space. Also, for everyone to discuss the BEST options for trading crypto at U.S. BASED crypto exchanges (U.S. entities). Of course, there are great exchanges abroad – but I would hope that people are interested in discussing what we have going on at home.

Opinion for viable options, not in specific order by any means:
GDAX/Coinbase Pro + Poloniex
CME + CBOE

For whatever reason, currently as a U.S. citizen you cannot obtain an account to trade on margin from top exchanges. Off-topic for a moment as to whether you can trade on margin abroad, broadly speaking the answer is no. Many people will bring up Kraken – that is for another conversation. Whether this is due to regulations regarding “eligible contract participant” (ECP) requirements and/or a mixture of other reasons (which is not completely clear to me) – the fact is, you may be able to find leverage somehow but not with the majors (so to speak). With that said, if you are a reputable individual with a clean background it should not be an issue to obtain an account from a major brokers and trade futures. Is it a viable time to partake in outright future or options on futures? Couldn’t answer this, but would I can say is there is a lot of potential!

What are futures? Here are some resources to learn:
http://www.cmegroup.com/courses/introduction-to-futures.html
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp  

What will need to happen for you to trade futures? Well, many people reading this article may not have the means to currently become involved due to high margin requirements. Can this change? Hopefully. 

How do margin requirements go down? Well, this has much to do with the value/scale of the product, but very importantly otherwise despite the measure of value: Liquidity! (reduced risk) 

How does liquidity come into play? Many factors, a major component being interest/confidence/trust amongst institutions/shops. 

VERY importantly: Outside of the crypto markets rallying or not – fundamentally, why is it reasonable to expect that institutions could become more and more comfortable? I’ve been asked, how do they trust the process? The context being, some traditional investors fear cryptocurrency infrastructure and being stolen from and wonder why institutions would partake. In terms of risk, not including the actual performance of the markets, it is important to understand that outright futures are CASH SETTLED (financially settled). Unlike several commodity futures such as crude oil – there is no “delivery” of Bitcoin which will occur. In simple words, when a “cash settled” futures contract reaches a “final settlement” you get squared away as if you bet on anything (very broad description). Basically, outside of the value of crypto or lack of liquidity there is an inherent layer of trust between institutions and CME/CBOE. Basically, the technology is NOT exotic.

But what is exotic about Bitcoin futures: Liquidity. To provide a sense of the daily volume for an extremely a liquid product, let’s refer to E-mini S&amp;P 500 Futures and compare this to Bitcoin futures at the CBOE and CME:

(excuse any errors)
E-mini S&amp;P 500 Futures
estimated volume: 1,583,103 (“ES” - June 19th 2018)
prior day open interest: 2,595,978
http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/e-mini-sandp500_quotes_settlements_futures.html

CME Bitcoin Futures (“BTC” - June 19th 2018)
estimated volume: 1,563
prior day open interest: 2,258
http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_volume_voi.html#tradeDate=20180425
Here you can see their daily exchange volume chart: http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_volume_voi.html#tradeDate=20180619

CBOE Bitcoin Futures (“XBT” - June 19th 2018)
trade volume: 1,824
open interest: 5,365
http://markets.cboe.com/us/futures/market_statistics/daily/


You can’t simply compare futures contracts for different products in terms of volume and the e-mini S&amp;P is an unfair comparison, but this is just to provide an example. Generally as an example, if a contract as the CME could have 50,000 (or less) trades per day and be perfectly fine by traders (with extra care). What does this mean? Basically, if you want to trade futures without allocating double digit thousands to the initial/maintenance margin – you better hope for a consistent increase in depth. In terms of “options on futures” (options), thin as well but this post is already extensive. 

One fact you can count on: Trading futures at U.S. centralized exchanges is the most, or one of the most “pure” forms of trading you will find in terms of forensic transparency and market infrastructure. In terms of **U.S based** exchanges which provide ability to trade in the cash, let’s hope we continue to see GDAX/Coinbase Pro infrastructure grow, in addition to Poloniex/Circle. I’m aware all crypto exchanges have been a pain in the ass one way or the other, but let’s be honest – who else are we depending on in terms of U.S. BASED companies?

Stablecoins will be pegged 1:1 with sovereign/national currencies. That means they'll still be subject to quantative easing etc, but they won't suffer from the same volatility as traditional cryptos like bitcoin and ethererum. 

As time goes on, consumers and merchants won't see the need to redeem their USDC for USD and therefore the adoption of USDC and other stablecoins increases, adding to the overall adoption of crypto. 

I believe that will be the time where Bitcoin's decentralised, immutable qualities will start to shine.

More and more people will get fed up of the constant increase in supply of USDC, GBPC, EURC etc and realise that their better off keeping their savings in BTC and only cashing out into the relevant stablecoin as and when they need to.

It's no problem since the old phone is still intact and I was able to close the channel there. 

This may have been obvious to more technical folks than I, but I'm pretty sure a MAJORITY of people would assume that the LN channel will be restored as part of the wallet. Someone could have dozens of open channels and lots of BTC that would be lost if their phone were lost or broken.

I know LN is still in beta and it was only a couple of mBTC that I was able to recover from my old phone. But, is this an issue with the Éclair wallet, the LN or me?"

8spbhj,1529558927,FizzlePopBerryTwist,5,3,My family learned a hard lesson about inflation today,"My grandmother purchased a $10,000 life insurance policy way back.  We're talking the 1970's or so.   Let's say conservatively 1986 or so.  Adjusting for inflation, the policy should be $33,000, right?  Well, it was never updated.  Never added to.  She just kept the same policy all this time.   

Now to be fair, all she wanted in the end was to be buried next to grandpa.  Well, that's about all she's getting.  After a brief battle with some kind of stealth cancer that wasn't showing up on scans or really causing any problems until the very end.  Since it was mostly her stomach she couldn't eat and then one by one problems accumulated like a domino effect, otherwise, she would still be here starting chemo this week.  When we found out that what she left behind to accomplish the goal of a simple funeral, it was barely enough for even that.

Now, we had driven her way out of state to get her the best cancer treatment we could, but they couldn't even begin because the end was already sneaking up on her it turned out.  But thankfully, it was closer to her state of origin or rather where grandpa is buried because a THIRD of our funds went to shipment.  All the rest is going to the burial process, clothes, and a 15 minute viewing.  A full service would have been $700 an hour!  This doesn't even include the price of the plot and stone, which thankfully, was already purchased long ago when the cemetary was having some kind of family plot sale.  The casket is all coming out of pocket and there's no money for a grave-side service.  They don't even know what time she'll be buried so we can't even make plans to randomly show up.  

Also, travel expenses accrued for the living because someone's RV had to have repairs.  

Best we can do is a memorial service at home at this point.  I already spent a lot of time with her moving her to the cancer center and was actually on my way back to visit when I got the news.  There's no sense in me flying out across the country for a 15 minute viewing though when what I really wanted was to see the rest of my family so instead I've spotted them RV repairs and they're coming to visit on their way back to the other end of the USA.  


tl;dr
So basically, the value of the life insurance policy is only a third of its original value!  Imagine if you had bought $10,000 in Bitcoin that long ago and since Bitcoin didn't even exist in 1986 imagine waiting that long, 30 years.  Just since 2008, $10k in BTC would be well over $200 million!  

The moral of the story:  **Cancer sucks.  Fiat sucks.  Eat healthy and invest healthy.  **"

""Dear User,

This is a VERY IMPORTANT announcement in light of the recent Reserve Bank of India circular: DBR.No.BP.BC.104 /08.13.102/2017-18 dated April 6, 2018.

Our industry has approached the Supreme Court of India to challenge the circular, as we feel it is counterproductive, and against the interest of citizens. As a responsible corporation, we regard customer-protection and market-integrity as our primary objectives. In light of that, please note that if Zebpay bank accounts are disrupted, rupee deposits and withdrawals will become impossible. This can cause discontinuation of crypto trade based on rupees, or at least cause significant price movements. This is something you should keep in mind if you choose to hold rupees in your Zebpay account.

Please note that you will not be able to withdraw rupees unless Zebpay has banking services that permit such withdrawal. Also, in case of disruption of banking services to Zebpay, you hereby indemnify Zebpay, and agree to hold Zebpay free and harmless at all times, against all claims, proceedings, expenses, costs, actions in the event of any prejudice and/or loss being caused to you by any act or omission by Zebpay or any other party, in regard to your rupee balance, transactions, trading, deposit, or withdrawal.

Of course, since our bank accounts are functional at the time writing this announcement, you are welcome to place a withdrawal request for your rupee balance. If you do that, we will endeavor to return your rupee balance to your bank account as soon as possible, so long as our banks support such withdrawal. If you choose to withdraw your rupees, please make sure to also cancel your unexecuted trade orders if any.

Regards,
Zebpay Team"""

I have some bitcoin in my Zebpay account and today I got an email from them saying they may shut down the withdrawal due to bank regulations any time. Since I am planning to keep my Bitcoins for years, I am better of moving them to a personal wallet than to some exchange. 

Can you kindly suggest what options I have considering I am in India.

The price held strong at about the level it is now, mid 6000's. 

While all this was going on, SQ got approved by NY state to process BTC and more merchants are using either BTCPAY or other systems to accept BTC.

More Bitcoin ATM's have also been going up all around the world.  

There are now people sitting with cash on the sidelines and waiting to get involved in Bitcoin. This holds true with any investment that has a big drop from it's high. 

Think about real estate and how much is dropped during the 08 crash. The recovery has been very strong in many markets, but most people who waited to get in missed out early on, they got in later and it kept driving the home prices higher and higher now for 8+ years! 

I can say the same about the US stock market and many other investments.

Any investment that has many people with cash sitting on the sidelines waiting to get involved, will always see the same pattern, it will start moving up, FOMO will kick in, and you will see the price rise to numbers nobody can explain.

Predicting a date when something will happen is a foolish thing to do, however, predicting a pattern or probability can be done with a high degree of certainty. 

My guess is that as soon as BTC breaks 7500 the move to 1000 will be within a week, at that time real FOMO kicks in and predicting how fast and how high it goes from there is impossible because with FOMO activated all common sense vanishes and with common sense vanishing everything is possible.

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/20/bitcoin-is-not-for-me-goldman-sachs-ceo-lloyd-blankfein-says.html


And he's right. There a lot that's interesting and innovative about Bitcoin--and the cryptographic protocol that it is is chiefly among them.

And sure, the people here get that.


But the name you use to describe something is also the entry-point you use to introduce it. For many, the name they use to describe something is the majority of what they understand about it. And so, ask yourself: What's the first thing people should know about these currencies? 

Is it how they work? (Crypto)

Or is it for what purpose? (Consensus)


Consensus currencies, i.e. not government currencies, not fiat currencies, not currencies controlled by some sovereign--but by us; by our agreement.


From that, the questions flow naturally: How does it work? Do people vote? How do you prevent cheating or stealing? And that is a great opportunity to teach them about the cryptographic protocols.


Eventually they'd ask the most obvious question: ""What if I don't agree?"", which might be the most beautiful aspect of the consensus mechanism and voluntary association. ""Then,"" you'd reply ""you simply start your own consensus of 1, and if your idea is a good one--get people to join in. That way, the largest currencies with the most robust consensus rose to the top by being the most reliable ones, backed by millions agreeing to work, associate and collaborate together"".


And in my opinion, if they know nothing else, that'd be the one thing to know.


Looking forward to your feedback on this idea."

 In May 2013, Liberty Reserve was shut down by United States federal prosecutors under the [Patriot Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act) after an investigation by authorities across 17 countries. The United States charged founder Arthur Budovsky and six others with [money laundering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering) and operating an unlicensed financial transaction company. Liberty Reserve is alleged to have been used to launder more than $6 billion in criminal proceeds during its history.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty\_Reserve#/media/File:Liberty\_Reserve\_seizure.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Reserve#/media/File:Liberty_Reserve_seizure.png)

 After its Closure I had seen users ,merchants ,everyone running to find an alternate payment method so now the traffic started adopting money,Obviously, Liberty Reserve is not the only e-wallet available on the market, however most of the alternatives are regulated and comply with way stricter requirements. [Moneybookers/Skrill](http://www.forexbrokerz.com/page/moneybookers-forex-brokers), for example, is regulated by the [FCA](http://www.forexbrokerz.com/page/fca-regulated-forex-brokers) in the UK, and demands document verification from its users so even if the payment provider is used for illegal purposes, the involved parties can easily be tracked down. And that is not the case with Liberty Reserve. 

Which is not to say that everyone who uses Liberty Reserve is a fraudster.

soon the merchant started using bitcoin and surprisingly the popularity started as there was no chargeback and completely anonymous for drugs king.

8stuzu,1529602622,ColdStorageCoins,1,0,Cold Storage Coins™ Confirmed to Join Experiential European Tour this Summer with The Evolving Caravan,"**SINGAPORE (PRWEB)** **JUNE 20, 2018**

European travelers this summer are in for a treat when the Evolving Caravan rolls into town, because this year the experiential tour includes the hottest item on the crypto circuit - Cold Storage Coins™. For those new to this wallet technology, or crypto in general The Evolving Caravan is excited to offer their latest hands-on experience, so people can finally “get it”.

Rob Gray, CEO of Cold Storage Coins™ says, “We’re partnering with some fantastic projects this year, but nothing is as unique as The Evolving Caravan. We love what the project is doing as a traveling transformational experience for entrepreneurs, and we’re honored they’re using CSC™ to spread wallet adoption”.

The Evolving Caravan offers an experiential travel immersive exploring a range of cutting-edge topics including: consciousness, human optimization and wellness, science, art, and culture, blockchain and emergent technologies. Forget stuffy workshops and seminars — “the Evolving Caravan is part mastermind, part roadtrip, part transformational retreat . . . and entirely magic.”

During the tour this summer, participants will have the opportunity to experience Cold Storage Coins™! They’ll discover how this cutting-edge wallet works and what it actually feels like to hold the value of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum in the palm of their hand. Cold Storage Coins™ will also be made able for purchase on the road, with the goal of raising awareness and larger adoption of blockchain technology.

As J from Evolving Caravan says, “Cold Storage Coins give people a tangible experience with blockchain technology in a way anyone can understand. We’re excited to have physical tokens that demonstrate the promise of blockchain technology, and hope that the industry continues to push for meaningful adoption of digital currencies in creative and effective ways.”

Cold Storage Coins™ mitigate common risks associated with storing crypto, and since their launch in February 2018, they’ve been flying off digital shelves and into the pockets of crypto enthusiasts who were craving something ultra-secure, but also collectible and cool. And like the Evolving Caravan, Cold Storage Coins’™ focus is on mass adoption of emerging and progressive ideas and technologies.

The Dates for the Evolving Caravan European Summer Tour are:

London: June 14-19   
Prague: June 21-25   
Amsterdam: June 27-July 1   
Portugal: July 19 – July 22

Don't need to get into the details of how that is achieved. What I want to know is since bitcoin price has risen and bitcoin itself is not being used on a daily basis for every day transactions and you only get the reward from mining if you are the first to solve the POW puzzle to create a new block, then doesn't that mean that bitcoin successful mining would become more scarce the more the price goes up because there are less transactions to verify therefore less opportunities to create a new block? How many transactions can be going on on a daily basis with bitcoin hitting $10k a pop and higher at times. I don't see many people walking around with $10,000 dollar bills and going and buying stuff. Seems like this would have brought successful mining efforts to a crawl."

Keep reading to understand how to manage your transactions.
 
Eric,

Security is a top priority at Capital One®. So as of August 1, 2018, we’re changing the limits for ACH external transfers to better protect your accounts.

Automated Clearing House (ACH) External Transfer Limits: Your 360 accounts will now be subject to limits on the amount of electronic transfers between your account and external accounts at other financial institutions. These limits are designed to be flexible in order to protect the security and integrity of the service and accounts, as well as you and all other users of the service. Based on confidential fraud and essential risk criteria, they may be modified at our discretion without advance notice.
• 	What transactions will this impact? ACH external transfers are electronic deposit and withdrawal transfers made between your Capital One accounts and your linked external accounts...""

So fine - new limits for ACH.
But what are they? This is never stated in the email they sent.

I call them - they DO NOT reveal the new limits to their customers.
""It's personalized for each person"" I was told.
""Then send me a personalized email with my limit"".
But that is not the policy and they will not do that.

Capital One will hold your money, and let you withdraw it, but are keeping the withdrawal via ACH limits a secret.

I'm 1/3 thru with withdrawing all funds from my Capital One accounts. Will be done with them by next week."

All **DEBTS**.

(Look at a dollar bill, on the front, near the upper-left corner.)

What is this saying?  It means, this is a ""general purpose IOU.""  What a **great** idea!  Bob owes Alice for the meal he just ate at her restaurant.  He gives her an IOU, but it's a general purpose IOU.  Bob got it from Duane, when Duane owed him something, and now Alice can give it to somebody else.  Excellent!

There's a problem, though.

We have a small group of people with the sole ability to create these IOUs, from thin air, by merely typing numbers into their bank computers.  Think about it: this is **theft**.  Why?  Because those bankers can use their freshly created IOUs to obtain ""stuff"" from the rest of us.  But we don't owe them anything -- they didn't give us anything, nor did they do any work for us.  They just ""take"" without our permission .  This is theft.

Here we have the ultra-rich central bankers and their cronies stealing from poor people, the middle class, the upper class,  the hard working, even the lazy.  Central bankers are thieves, thieves are criminals.

And **THIS**, boys and girls, is part of the **Beauty of Bitcoin.**

No banker, and no stupid, sociopathic politician can create Bitcoin from ""thin air"" (by merely typing numbers into a computer).  If they want to create Bitcoin, **they'll have to follow the rules** just like the rest of us -- they'll have to buy a mining rig (or a whole bunch of them), and they'll have to buy electricity, and find some way to cool the mining rigs...

When we all use Bitcoin/crypto, instead of central banker ""play money"", the criminal bankers won't be able to just type a number into a computer, then bail out some fuck face like Warren Buffet at our expense.  Buffet will go broke, like he should have a long time ago.  And the rest of us will be able to thrive better.

**Long live Bitcoin!**"

Aspiring teams who aim to establish their own digital asset exchanges, only need to provide their domain names, logos, operation force, and to focus on the management and operations of the exchange. OKEx's global technical team, on the other hand, will provide R&amp;D and system maintenance supports to the teams, who will share the high liquidity and advanced trading experience offered by the world-leading digital asset exchange.

The 1st phase of the program offers 100 places for participating teams. Applicants are required to deposit 500,000 OKB in their accounts, excluding the amount locked for Designated Merchant, New Listing Vote, and Prime Investors. The ideal candidates for OK Partners should possess solid industry experience, quest for service excellence, and strong industry influence. The 1st phase is expected to go online in late July. Interested parties should submit their contact person's name and phone number as well as team description to [okbd@okex.com](mailto:okbd@okex.com) for application.

More detailed information, please find on OKEx website

I wanted to share something many of you living in a 1st tire world countries might not relate to.
I live in Egypt ... a beautiful very old place .. with inflation rate constantly between 7% -20% for the past 40 years, and some times 35% like last year.
The value of our fiat currency with is called the Egyptian pound compared to the US dollar is as follows .. 3.8 EGP/USD in 2001 , 8.8 EGP/USD in 2016 , 17.9 EGP/USD today.
Saving money for future in our fiat currency have worked very very badly as you can tell, top 1% of our society control around 48% of the wealth, and those doesn't own fiat, they own land, gold, factories and other assets .. leaving us with the worthless fiat paper.
Freeing the exchange rate for our currency in November/2016 wiped out half the value of the fiat holdings for all the Egyptians. 

And here comes the moral of this little story, Letting the money valuation in the hand of some old stupid corrupt individuals in the government who wasted our hard earned money through their stupid selfish decisions is not right and can never work in the favor of the people, I as another 100 million Egyptians have seen and felt it.
This story is very common if you looked closely to other countries like Greek, Turkey, Bolivia, Iraq, Argentina and many countless African nations.

I believe in Bitcoin because i trust Math and logic more than i trust my government corrupted officials.
I believe in Bitcoin because i am okay with it going up or down, when knowing with my fiat there's only one way the DOWN way.

Have a nice day you all, and as always HODL :)"

Bubbles bursting and bear markets.,"Don't ridicule (too much) shitcoin zaelots, they serve a very, very real and useful purpose - Distract people and divert attention to ""*The next Bitcoin!*""

Here's the thing, Bitcoin is absolutely amazing and *will* achieve everything that has been said so often, **but**... it's not ready for global adoption. Yet. Never mind global adoption, it's not even ready for all the crypto users! Think about the blockchain bloat (or better fees) if *all* the transactions of all shitcoins combined had to happen on Bitcoin! Fees would be truly astronomical, and we're not ready for that. And the LN is also not ready for that yet.

Building the ""Internet of money"" takes time. Building it without clusterfucks takes even more time. Shitcoins provide the devs tons of breathing room.

&amp;nbsp;

Bubbles and bear markets? Same thing, scare the weak hands away. Learn to appreciate and cherish the bear market, you can also get coins for cheap(er)!

&amp;nbsp;

- Having to fill out papers
- Having to answer questions why I am sending money and where it came from
- Having to pay $20 to send my money
- Being charged 3% for currency exchange
- Having to wait 3-5 business days for money to arrive

That's in Canada. In other places like Malaysia the bank systems are even more archaic.

- Having to pay to get bank statements older than 3 months
- Having to wait 2 weeks to receive them (really!)
- Having to go to the branch to get most things done

Bitcoin removes all of these annoyances. If anyone asks why Bitcoin is worth anything... replacing these old, slow and inefficient banking systems with Bitcoin/LN is a *huge* improvement. 

And I've barely scraped the surface of what it is changing for the world's *unbanked* and other use cases where current banks are annoyingly archaic.

For a digital coin to actually work well as a global gold/money alternative, it should be as fairly and widely distributed as possible.

Even with almost a decade of history and a very uncertain beginning in which people literally gave away coins to everyone else for free, Bitcoin is still in the hands of barely a few million people according to most estimates.

One of the main problems of any newer coin is that, even if the new system is much more advanced than Bitcoin in terms of software capabilities (which by the way I don't think it is the case for most if not all of them), they are miles behind in the distribution of their ""coins"" and that's a huge issue because as we've seen, the most concentrated the coin possession is, the most volatile the price is because of the sudden demand/offer waves that inevitably hit the market.

And it is actually kind of a requirement for a coin to work well as money or even long term store of value to develop price stability, which gives it more usability outside the trading/speculation world and hence legitimacy in the traditional sense.

In the current market correction we're experiencing exactly that and you can see it daily in CoinMarketCap: when BTC is up 2%, 2nd coin is often up 2x that and much newer, less established coins are up 5x that amount. And the same happens when BTC is down but in the opposite way. That's a great way to make money trading/speculating but that's not usable for a mainstream store of value/medium of exchange.

Unless there is a newer coin that ""invents"" a much fairer initial distribution of coins (ICOs are in NO WAY a fair initial distribution, and let's be honest, they were designed to make money to founders and initial investors), there's no technology advancement that can accelerate the process of worldwide distribution that Bitcoin started almost a decade ago and which, in my opinion, will give it an unsurmountable advantage in the foreseeable future."

As You All Know RBI has Repeatedly Cautioned Users , Holders and Traders of Virtual Currencies , Including BITCOINS , Regarding various Risk Associated in Dealing with such Virtual Currencies on Following Dates:

December 24, 2013
February 01, 2017
December 05, 2018

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Kept on Saying that We Have Made a Committee to Analyze and Discuss the Matter of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies and Waiting for it's Report. Meanwhile RBI (Reserve Bank of India) Suddenly Sent Notices on 6th April 2018 to Exchanges and Banks About Not to Deal with Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies with Immediate Effect and Gave Three Months Time to Close the Operation.

Many Petition Were Filed Against RBI's Decision and Brought the Matter to High Court. Hight Court Simply Denied the Appeal and Said that all Such Matter Regarding Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Shall be Discussed Only in Supreme Court.
Before Few Days SC (Supreme Court) also Said Banks and Appellant to Resolve the Matter at Their Level.

The Next Hearing Will Be On 20th July, 2018 in Supreme Court.

What Will Happen On 6th July?

The Crypto to Fiat Operation of Exchanges Like Zebpay , Unocoin and Other Indian Exchagnes Will Be Stopped On 6th July, But Crypto to Crypto Trading Will Be Operative.

Meanwhile Indians..!! You Guys Can Trade Your Bitcoins in Localbitcoins For These Days**

Do You Need To Worry About it?

No, Not at all.

We Have Found Something Which Needs To be Discussed Here.

A Person Named Varun Sethi Filed an RTI Against RBI On 9th May and Asked the Following Questions :

1. You( RBI) Warned People About Not to Deal In Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Several Times (Three Times ).

 Did You Make Any Committee for this ?
   
  RBI's Answer : No

2. Can You Provide us the Members Details of Committee?

   RBI's Answer : We Have Not Made and Committee so We Can Not Provide Any Details.

3.  How did You Come To Know about the Risk Associated With Bitcoins and Other Cryptocurrencies
   
  RBI's Answer:  What is Sought is Not Information as Defined  in Section 2(f) of the RTI Act 2005.
   ( According to this Act they said that Such Type of Information about Blockchain and Bitcoin, Any Evidence , Any Paper ,    Any Model or Any Electronic Material is not avaiable Online)

4. Did You Collect Any Information About Blockchain From Any Other Countries Federal Bank
   
  RBI's Answer: No

5. Did You Take Any Measures To Adopt Blockchain Technology in Banking Sector

   RBI's Answer: No

6. Does These Rules and Regulations Apply on State Bank of Sikkim?

   RBI's Answer: State Bank of Sikkim Comes Under Us But We did not Provide any Notice to them

Can You Guys Look at the Answers of RBI. 
They did make the decision Without Any Adequate Reserach Which is Merely Speculative one.
We Belive that Cryptocurrencies are More likely to be Regulated Instead of Ban.
Regulations do Require Comprehensive Sets of Rules Which Requires Some time too.
Whithin Few Months or May be Few Years it will Be Regulated in India.

The regulator said it’s going to focus mainly on the enforcement of anti-money laundering policies, while remaining open towards innovations like those coming from the crypto sector.**

***Also read:*** [***Bitcoin Businesses Denied Banking Services in Ireland***](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-businesses-denied-banking-services-in-ireland/)

## Not Stifling Innovation

📷With the executive power in Taipei still mulling over new regulations for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), representatives of Taiwan’s financial regulator indicated their unwillingness to slow down progress in the fintech industry. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will mainly focus on one of its core duties – overseeing the enforcement of anti-money laundering policies, and will continue to welcome innovations that come with digital currencies.

During a press conference on Thursday, Banking Bureau Deputy Director Sherri Chuang said the FSC prefers to monitor developments and avoid stifling early-stage growth. Quoted by *The* *Taipei Times*, she emphasized:

&gt;***The commission maintains an open stance and welcomes all industry innovations.***

Chuang also noted that cryptocurrencies, and the tokens issued through ICOs, which are classified as commodities at this stage, do not currently fall under the commission’s jurisdiction. The regulator is only involved in preventing money laundering through virtual assets, the official reiterated before the media. Sherri Chuang compared the situation with that of the lease finance companies, where the involvement of the regulator is also limited to money laundering prevention.

📷According to another representative of the commission, Securities and Futures Bureau Chief Secretary Chien Hung-ming, ICOs do not cross any regulatory red lines in Taiwan. He explained that each coin offering would be assessed on a case-by-case basis, noting that regulators are primarily concerned with examining the fundraising prospects of the respective token sale.

The FSC will assess each issuance to determine if the digital coin should be classified as a security or a virtual commodity, Chien added. “It is very difficult to define broadly, as each case is different,” the FSC official pointed out.

## Not Following China

The Executive Yuan, or the Taiwanese government, has yet to develop and adopt comprehensive regulations for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings. In April, high-ranking officials indicated that the respective legislative framework should be developed and introduced by November, 2018, as news.Bitcoin.com [reported](https://news.bitcoin.com/taiwanese-bitcoin-regulations-expected-november-2018/).

According to a statement by Taiwan’s Justice Minister, Qiu Taisan, the government intends to task the FSC with developing the regulatory system for digital currencies. The Ministry of the Interior, the Investigation Bureau, and the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) are expected to assist the commission.

Although cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been increasingly mentioned as a subject of concern, mainly in the light of money laundering, Taiwan is not likely to severely restrict them. Last year the chairman of the FSC, Wellington Koo, confirmed that the country would not adopt a prohibitive regulatory framework like the one implemented in China.

Earlier in April, Taiwan’s Central Bank [signaled](https://news.bitcoin.com/taiwan-to-regulate-bitcoin-under-anti-money-laundering-laws/) it would favor regulating cryptocurrencies under the country’s existing anti-money laundering laws. Its new governor, Yang Chin-long, suggested that the Ministry of Justice should include bitcoin in the scope of ROC’s Money Laundering Control Act.

I bought coffee with btc. Today that btc would have bought me a car. Inflation in your face (and i’m not comparing to fiat. I’m comparing to coffee and car).

Lost coins = inflation. 
Stolen coins = no insurance. Irreversible even if you can prove it. Hard forks don’t scale beyond one every few years so stolen coins are forever.

We know there was a massive transfer of wealth in December and January.  But honestly.  **Who owns crypto today?**

I’ve been in Bitcoin since February 2015, and bought my first Bitcoin for $227.  I then told all my friends to buy Bitcoin and get on.  No one listened until we hit about $2500 in the summer of 2017.  Then everyone was calling me and asking me how to get in on this.  Many of my friends got in.  

Now my friends have no idea how the blockchain works or anything and were just trying to make money.  They do not resemble how our community looked back before 2017 *(although maybe closer to how it looks today)*

Anyways, all my newbie friends, now in mid 2018, don’t love Bitcoin as much.  But they fall into two camps.  

1. Guys that sold off.  The ones that got in around $2000, mostly sold off around the $8000 to $12,000 range and all super happy.  But they’re out and thank me all the time.  They love seeing the price drop and are thinking about getting in, if it keeps going down and stops dropping 10&amp;#37; in one day.  
2. Others believe in it after seeing December and are holding, and hoping for a repeat of December 2017 or believe Bitcoin is the future.  These guys are holding They won’t be selling unless we skyrocket or they just see it as a crazy gamble and enjoy it *(but not so much lately)*

This comes to my point.  To me, with Bitcoin sitting at $6000.  I find it super hard to see any retail investor outside of these two camps.  I mean the guys like me that have been in since 2015 sold some *(I started selling at $2500)* but probably still hold some like me as well because we believe in the project plus the very real opportunity that this will jump to $85,000 or higher come 2020.  

But … my question is this.    **WHO IS SELLING ?**

Who is in Bitcoin today, and seen the price just get destroyed, and now they are like…. *“Now I will sell at $6000”* …. uh .. what?  You had six months to sell, why now finally?

Please explain this to me.  I just feel like anyone who wanted to get out is out.  The guys in now are the holders or the believers or the day traders.  Or they're brand new.  

I just don’t see anyone in, who is saying, *“well, if we hit $4500, I’m gone”*, but I do know a lot of people saying *“if we hit $4500, I am coming back in”* or they are getting in now.  

The other thing is this.  With all the media, start ups, ICOs, etc etc.  This crypto space is so much bigger than it was last summer.  We're only up 300&amp;#37; in a year?  How is that possible?  Binance has gone from 2m to 9m customers just in 2018.  I mean that is 450&amp;#37; growth.    


**Maybe I am living in a bubble.**  

So is the market just so manipulated by one or two massive whales nothing I am saying matters?  

Or am I just wishful thinking and we're headed back to $227 when I started?"

I have a deep understanding of the Detroit real estate market and I am interested in managing an opportunity fund here in Detroit. Does this sound interesting to anyone? I figured maybe there are some people on here that hit it big with bitcoin and would like to sell some and avoid paying taxes.

A large portion of the City of Detroit is included within the opportunity zone and with the recent news of Ford's acquisition and renovation of the Michigan Central Station there is a lot of opportunity in Detroit.

 [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/opportunity-zones-frequently-asked-questions](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/opportunity-zones-frequently-asked-questions)

## Q. What is an Opportunity Zone?

A. An Opportunity Zone is an economically-distressed community where new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. Localities qualify as Opportunity Zones if they have been nominated for that designation by the state and that nomination has been certified by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury via his delegation authority to the Internal Revenue Service.

## Q. Who created Opportunity Zones?

A. Opportunity Zones were added to the tax code by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017.

## Q. Have Opportunity Zones been around a long time?

A. No, they are new. The first set of Opportunity Zones, covering parts of 18 states, were designated on April 9, 2018.

## Q. What is the purpose of Opportunity Zones?

A. Opportunity Zones are an economic development tool—that is, they are designed to spur economic development and job creation in distressed communities.

## Q. How do Opportunity Zones spur economic development?

A. Opportunity Zones are designed to spur economic development by providing tax benefits to investors. First, investors can defer tax on any prior gains until the earlier of the date on which an investment is sold or exchanged, or December 31, 2026, so long as the gain is reinvested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund. Second, if the investor holds the investment in the Opportunity Fund for at least ten years, the investor would be eligible for an increase in basis equal to the fair market value of the investment on the date that the investment is sold or exchanged.

## Q. What is a Qualified Opportunity Fund

A. Qualified Opportunity Fund is an investment vehicle that is set up as either a partnership or corporation for investing in eligible property that is located in an Opportunity Zone and that utilizes the investor’s gains from a prior investment for funding the Opportunity Fund.

## Q. Do I need to live in an Opportunity Zone to take advantage of the tax benefits?

A. No. You can get the tax benefits, even if you don’t live, work or have a business in an Opportunity Zone. All you need to do is invest in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.

## Q. I am interested in investing in an Opportunity Zone. Is there a list of Opportunity Zones available?

A. Yes. The current list of approved Opportunity Zones can be found at [Opportunity Zones Resources](https://www.cdfifund.gov/Pages/Opportunity-Zones.aspx). This list will continue to be updated as more Opportunity Zones are approved. A complete list of approved Opportunity Zones will be published later this spring after all Opportunity Zones have been nominated, certified and designated.

## Q. How does a taxpayer become certified as a Qualified Opportunity Fund?

A. To become a Qualified Opportunity Fund, an eligible taxpayer self certifies.  (Thus, no approval or action by the IRS is required.)  To self-certify, a taxpayer merely completes a form (which will be released in the summer of 2018) and attaches that form to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return for the taxable year.  (The return must be filed timely, taking extensions into account.)

## Q.  I sold some stock for a gain in 2018, and, during the 180-day period beginning on the date of the sale, I invested the amount of the gain in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.  Can I defer paying tax on that gain?

A. Yes, under § 1400Z-2(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, you may elect to defer the tax on some or all of that gain.  If, during the 180-day period, you had invested in one or more Qualified Opportunity Funds only an amount that was less than your entire gain, you may still elect to defer paying tax on part of the gain, up to the amount that you invested in that way.

## Q. How do I elect to defer my gain on the sale of the stock?

A.  You may make an election to defer the gain, in whole or in part, when filing your 2018 Federal Income Tax return in 2019 (that is, you may make the election on the return on which the tax on that gain would be due if you do not defer it). 

## Q. I sold some stock on December 15, 2017, and, during the required 180-day period, I invested the amount of the gain in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.  Can I elect to defer tax on that gain?

A. Yes, as long as it was invested in the 180-day period, under § 1400Z-2(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, you may elect to defer the tax on that gain.  A deferral election may be made on your 2017 Federal Income Tax return.  Information about the sale of your stock is required to be included in that return using IRS Form 8949.  Precise instructions on how to use that form to elect deferral of the gain for your 2017 return will be forthcoming shortly. 

## Q. Can I still elect to defer tax on that gain if I have already filed my 2017 tax return?

A. Yes.  You may elect to defer the gain, but you will need to file an amended 2017 return.  As part of that amended return, you will follow the election procedure described in the answer to the preceding question."

He pointed out that he is paying his tax accountant more than he pays the IRS in actual tax. This is because of ridiculous requirement to file multi page documents in relation to each purchase or payment he makes in bitcoin.

This issue is a major stumbling block that severely penalizes law abiding citizens of the USA and like minded countries.  Only wealthy Americans (I define this as those who can afford to buy and hold for the long term) will be able to participate. As it stands the great unbanked living in the third world are going to inherit the wealth that comes with this new tech and the middle class and below in the USA will not. The USA as a country will lose out economically to its Asian rivals who have opened the floodgates.

The USA needs to introduce laws swiftly around discretionary spending in bitcoin. They Japan and Australia who have already introduced such measures.

Please upvote this thread to get this point heard. It is in my view one of the biggest hurdles to bitcoin adoption in many first world countries. It is not transaction fees or speed that is the major issue anymore.

If you agree please retweet on other social media wherever possible."

8t9j9c,1529755874,shryu1220,1,1,Token economy and smart contract are not related to public blockchain,"In my last article, I have argued that the public blockchain is a contradiction in its own proposition.  Nevertheless, to avoid the argument that arguments are abstract and theoretical and may not be the same as reality  As a detailed example, I will explain why the two publicly known blockbusters known as the changes in the future society are not related to the public blockchain. •Token economy  The benefit of a public blockchain is 'enhanced security'.  It is also possible in private blockchain.  Securing in a private block chain means that a single entity (enterprise, foundation) can release tokens that are not double-paid.  It can be implemented in a private block chain of any type that the public block chiners imagine, whether it be a payment token, a utility token, or a platform token.  This proves that the token economy is not only available in public blockchain.  In a public blockchain, however, you may argue that tokens are not only gift certificates, but also represent ownership.  A certificate representing ownership is a security.  Tokens with securities functions are just securities, and tokens with gift certificates only are mileage or electronic gift certificates.  The unique thing about the token market in public block chains is that there are many tokens that combine those two functions.  It is a securities, it can be used as a gift certificate, or a gift certificate. It is also used as a securities.  Except for the fact that you can still do it without a blockchain,  What economic benefits do it have to put the gift certificates and securities functions in one voucher?  Would not it be better to distribute gift certificates to shareholders holding securities or to distribute securities to those who purchased the product?  No one is wondering why we should combine those two functions.  The more tokens with many functions, the more valuable they are, so you just put them together.  Even if a new certificate combining securities and gift certificates yields better economic results, it can not be said to be unique in the blockchain technology.  It means that the person working in the blockchain industry has created a new economic system, not a block chain. •Smart contract  Dapp is software that is built on this smart contract, so I will define it essentially the same.  Smart contract is an irreversible contract that anyone can create on a block chain.  Now, using centralized services, these features are now everywhere!  The key to the definition of smart contracts is the 'irreversible contract' that anyone can make.  Anyone can create and publish apps in the App Store.  We do e-commerce, which is an 'electronic contract', on a centralized server.  The irreversible contract that we are not able to do with the 'irreversible' contract is (usually) illegal, so the platform we use is providing reversible services!  Demand for irreversible contracts can be absorbed by centralized services. •conclusion  Smart contracts are already commercialized for centralized services, and the token economy is an economic model that can exist independently of technology."

If they cost less than 5.8k then, I make a profit. Either way, you were going to hodl on, but this way, you also win $200 after 6 months.

Is there a platform for doing this, that enforces the contract? Can it be done by using Bitcoin's properties alone? If trust wouldn't be a problem,  what are your reasons for not going this route?"

There were libertarians,  anarchist, programmers, etc. with many different views and posts everyday on interesting articles whether it’s political, financial, speculative, educational, or on new developments, etc. where did they all go? It seems like every post on this sub is talking about prices and trolls calling for $5 bitcoins. And it seems like people are seeking government regulations on crypto? But wasn’t the whole point of crypto to over throw those centralized entities that control the money who ultimately control the world? What has changed? What did i miss? Where all those smart people go? Was it all a giant scam to lure people in and they cashed out? Or is this just a natural way of a bear market and how it effects the community? Im confused af.

They said in their mass email (and it even still states in their FAQ) that BCH accidentally sent to a BTC address after the fork but before they opened up their platform to BCH would be credited to the associated accounts. They never credited me.

I opened a support request LONG AGO, shortly after they opened their platform to BCH, indicating that I was never credited for my BCH. They've avoided dealing with it ever since. They told me they'd research it and get back to me, after which they silently closed my support ticket without notifying me, and have since told me on several occasions that they are aware of the issue and will have a specialist research it. I would hope that a specialist could figure this out in, I don't know, 5 minutes. I mean, it took me 10 minutes to figure it out. Everything is right there on the public ledger... BCH going to the address associated with my wallet.

It has been more than 6 months. Still nothing. I'm now trying to sue them for it, but I don't know who I need to have served because they will not tell me who their agent of service is. Does anyone know this information? Should I just list their corporate address for serving the court documents?

I can't imagine this is going to go over well for them when I finally have my day in court... and yet, they're still super uncooperative and are clearly not interested in giving me back the money that is rightfully mine.

Can someone help?"

I have been thinking about this for a while, now i'm finally putting it to words. We all hope deeply that Bitcoin and all other assets in the market bring us great wealth in the future, of course. We all know how incredible this revolution is, and we (generally), consider ourselves early investors into something great. What i'm saying here isnt my personal outlook necessarily, I just think its an important perspective for all of us to have in the background during all of this as I think it is moderately a possibility.

Now here's a theory of mine...For the most part, we take this market day-by-day, constant daily analysis' predicting the next ""bull run"". I feel as though bears in this space are constantly ridiculed because of the false hope that the perma-bulls have, based on nothing really except alot of people to agree with them. What if we're all just holding onto nothing? Bitcoin saw an absolutely fu*king insane run in 2017, fueled by absolute exuberance and greed, as most markets are.

Bitcoin just about touched 20k, now we're down to the low 6k level. Most everyone here has seen that chart that labels ""denial"", ""disbelief"", ""fear, and ""despair"" all throughout the market cycle. What if the big money guys are pulling this down farther than any of us are prepared for? Most of us are looking for any sign of life in this market, and so many people FOMO at the sight of a green candle. The major market movers could so easily just play with our emotions all the way down to the hundreds, its VERY unlikely that we will see those kinds of levels IMO, but I really don't want you guys to rule the possibility out.

Bitcoin is a bubble, it just is. I do not by any means believe 20k was the highest we will ever see it, no, but to deny that Bitcoin is one massive bubble is just ignorance...We've all heard of the tulip bubble so many years ago, and yes this one is very different as there is an actual use case and a massive revolution of technology and innovation behind it, but we're so damn early in this that it could so easily replicate that.

I know a lot of you are thinking as you're reading this, ""Bitcoin has no reason to go lower than the cost of mining it"", and you're very likely right, but again, anything is possible.

I know i'm kind of all over the place here, i'd love to talk to you guys in the comments and hear your opinions."

Renting hashing power online is a great way to start mining cryptocurrencies without having to make the investment in mining equipment. So which one ranks among the most [trusted cloud mining sites](https://www.nicehash.com/buy?refby=686864)?

This site allows you to buy hashing power for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Dash, Zcash, Litecoin and other coins and get paid in bitcoin. There's no contracts so if mining doesn't turn a profit for you, you can immediately stop your investment.

[NiceHash](https://www.nicehash.com/buy?refby=686864) has real miners who use their own mining equipment which is connected to the site's multipool so you'll never have to worry if the mining equipment actually exists.

### Buy and Sell Hashing Power‎

So if you want to start cryptocurrency mining but you've been hesitant because of shady cloud mining services, this is the solution that you've been looking for.

You'll get access to a host of user-friendly features for buyers including:

A minimum order price of 0.005 Bitcoin for every algorithm  
No contracts, no risk. You may cancel at any time without a cancellation fee  
Only pay only for valid shares  
Mine on any pool you want, when you want  
Get access to real-time statistics &amp; dashboard

The best part about cloud mining sites is that unlike actual bitcoin mining, you don't have to spend weeks learning about mining hardware and software in order to get everything set up. In fact, with this site you can actually be up and running in just a few minutes.

Getting started in this site is easy. All you need to do is:

1. Register a new account and deposit BTC.  
2. Add the mining pool you want to direct your purchased hashing power to.  
3. Set the fixed price or bid for mining and then create a new order.  
4. Monitor your order on the marketplace.

Another reason to consider cryptocurrency cloud mining is the fact that you can time your entry so that you can make the most of your investments. Getting in on cryptocurrency cloud mining while bitcoin prices are low means better returns later on versus having to invest in expensive mining hardware upfront.

So if you just want to learn how it works and place some initial orders, you can sign up for free to check it out for yourself.

[Click here](https://www.nicehash.com/buy?refby=686864) to join and you'll also get a free guide to buying hashing power with tips on efficient mining. "

8tdrld,1529795893,cryptogoon69,0,1,"Winter in the bitcoin beanstalk forest, an analogy of the current market"," As the price continues to tumble; I'm sure many of the newcomers are beginning to question the legitimacy of this project. If we view bitcoin as a traditional stock or currency which I believe the majority of newcomers are; then of course, a 66&amp;#37; loss is unacceptable and borderline fraudulent. However, I am here to remind you that bitcoin is neither a traditional currency, stock, security or any previous asset class we have seen, which is reason for it's volatility. Keep in mind that Bitcoin is only 10 years old and is the FIRST of it's kind to exist. 

Let us use the analogy of magic beans from Jack and the beanstalk to represent bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto as the mysterious bean wizard. This seemly normal bean planted a decade ago has now grown into an anomaly; attracting a large crowd of onlookers who are trying to decide if the beans are truly magic.

Most are watching from the sidelines; trying to decide if these beans are really magic or just a charlatans trick. They are watching other's buy and sell, not actively participating yet still curious and paying attention. The beanstalk has captured the attention of the MSM and all kinds of financial gurus are pitching their pitches for what this strange plant really is. 

Some have purchased many of these beans without questioning the magic and validity behind the beans, seeing as how quickly they grew in the months prior. When the beans failed to grow as quickly as they expected and even shrunk, they dismissed the wizard's magic as quickly as they believed him and labeled both the wizard and the beanstalk a phony. They do not care about the magic behind the beans, but the treasures inside the castle in the sky which the beanstalk will take them too when it becomes sufficiently strong and powerful. 

The true HODLers, early adopters, libertarians and cypherpunks are those who bought and planted the magic beans from the mysterious internet wizard with promises that the beans will someday grow strong roots and take them to the utopia in the clouds. Skeptical at first, they studied the magic behind the beans to better understand how it works. Some from this group have even learned how to read the spells written by the magic internet wizard and are writing their own spells to improve and help the beanstalk grow.  For them, bitcoin truly is this generation's magic beans, they understand it will not happen overnight yet they are confident in its success. It is a matter of ""when"" not ""if"". 

Currently the beanstalk is not growing but the magic behind it IS and it remains unaffected. Hash rates are increasing, lightning network continues to expand, more wallets are being created and exchange volumes are many times what they were a year ago. If you look at the logarithmic growth of bitcoin since inception, it has been on a steady incline, only when you zoom in do you see the bumps. 

The beanstalk has even grown large enough that it is no longer a single stump and has several branches now, all moving in different directions but towards the same destination. What's more surprising is that the beanstalk has even spawned seeds, creating a forest of similar magic beanstalks, each with their own magic spells; some weaker and some stronger. 

Right now it is winter in the magic beanstalk forest. The work of the mysterious internet wizard is done, the seed has been planted. The believers are doing their best to learn magic and help the beanstalk grow. The newcomers are trying to figure out why their beans aren't growing in winter and may be angry for believing in the mysterious internet wizard for promising them riches beyond belief. The widowed mother will never believe in the magic of these beans until they have reached the clouds while the onlookers grow increasingly in numbers and curiosity. Which one are you? "

But I really need to  believe in its potential as a legitimate currency before I buy-- I feel like too many people just buy because they think the price is going to go up.

Here's the thing for me: imagine a society where everyone only used bitcoin. If the network is as anonymous as I understand it to be, we (as individuals or as businesses) could simply not pay taxes and never get caught. The government would collect zero dollars in tax revenues, right? 

Thus, I don't see a possible world where the governments ever let bitcoin exist as a functional currency. Governments could easily ban businesses from accepting bitcoin payments and that would prevent bitcoin from ever being a commonplace currency. Change my mind and I'll start investing."

They have not reinvested the money they made from last year with fees. They seem want to extract as much money as possible from the crypto markets and don't care if its successful or not.

Coinbase doesn't care about adoption or crypto long term. They only care about making money through fees. Boycott Coinbase please. Use Square (Cash App) instead.

\- had a good mining operation going on between 2012-2015, which gathered over 17 btc in total.

\- sold about 13 at the average price of over $1000 during 2013-14 run and bought a car (obviously not a lambo)

\- in 2015 everything I had (\~4btc) was put in a cold storage and I vowed to never touch them until it hits &gt;$100k

\- last month I got into a DUI crash and totaled the same car I bought in 2014, and I did not have an adequate insurance.

\- shelled 2btc for a another car and criminal attorney.

So basically now I have 1.92btc left and 10k in CC-debt, which recently started charging 17&amp;#37; ARP. I do have a job, but I also have 2 kids and looming lawyer costs for DUI case and separate immigration case. And thus my dilemma is:

\--- should I sell btc to close the CC, and slowly buy with my extra cash on a monthly basis? or should I don't touch btc and keep paying the CC interest? The latter option would be well worth if the price recovers in a year. But I've been through number of ups-and-downs, and I just don't ""feel"" like we would reach the highs anytime soon.

Please give me strength to hodl and enlighten me on how should I keep my lambo dream alive."

Maybe someone can help me out.

I have a Trezor. Now, I have my private seed safe, which I like.

However:

My privacy is not safe. Because when I use the Trezor Wallet, my local browser is connecting the (bitcore) servers of Trezor. So my public key's are exploted.  So I am not using my own trustable Bitcoin full node.

I tried to install my own Bitcore server, but I can not get that worked.

I tried to run Etherum Personal Server (EPS) to connect Etherum to. In Etherum I can use my Trezor. That works. But i do not like this, because it is a difficult setup. Also EPS is in beta.

I have three questions:

1. Is it true that when I use the Trezor Wallet, Trezor will know my transaction history and public addresses I am watching?
2. Is there another way I can solve this?
3. Ehm.... am I the only one having this problem? Are my expectations to high? I expect, when I buy a product like Trezor, it will be totally safe, using the strengths of Bitcoin and so it is possible with this product to use my own full node.  Is it strange when I say this is not a mature part of bitcoin (having the private key in a hardware wallet and using your own bitcoin full node)

It looks like I better can use the official bitcoin wallet (bitcoin-qt) because that one I can trust and throw away my Trezor.  I understood it is a HD wallet.

Thanks"

In light of the rapid loss of value and there being nothing to stop this from continuing, I wanted to make sure that everyone who is holding the coin is aware of this so that they at least have a proper investment thesis formulated.

The basic idea falls under the Labor Theory of Value, however this theory is a fallacy and does not hold up under market dynamics. Just because a person spends a lot of time or resources creating an object, does not mean that that object has value on the market. "

Then after the beating he would run them a bath and give them pills too make them feel better. The recipient would be so grateful for the bath and medication, aka feeling better. That they would forget that it was Iceberg who beat them to begin with.

The tech development doesn't care about price. The top devs certainly don't care. Do you think brilliant devs who sacrifice everything for bitcoin improvements like Dr. Wuille care about price?

Will this be the same with bitcoin?   
Will tax on bitcoin have to be paid in bitcoin?  
Will there be VAT on bitcoin purchases?

All these questions, that, although BTC shows potential and is migrating more and more into every day lives, will it cause another ""credit bubble"" of sorts and end up causing the next inflationary crash cycle?

If BTC is a unified currency and I can trade in China paying for my items in BTC, this will also remove the need for currency exchanging (across some of the minors anyway) and would then effect the economy as a whole. How would interest rates work if we are unified in paying with BTC?

Interesting stages are to come with this and it could be very great or be a massive downfall in global economy. It could make redundant all of the Central Banks's efforts of QE...

Just a thought.

No one, however, seems to be focused on regulation in the crypto market. Currently, many businesses and merchants are hesitant about accepting crypto because of how vague the laws are. This is not just a problem in the US, many countries have either made vague laws or even no laws about crypto. It is very expensive to find attornies and other professionals that specialize in crypto-related matters. I and many others are also confused about taxes in the crypto market. It is very confusing and risky at this time. Are people going to be taxed when they sell out or when they buy? What if people never sell out and just keep their money in crypto? There is no way for governments to tax crypto if it remains in their wallets. Online businesses and merchants accepting crypto could possibly be fined or prosecuted if they do not comply with extremely vague and confusing policies.

Have you noticed?
Bitcoin price starts dwindelling a week after CBOE started to launch their first 1btc contract and then after a week the CME started offering 5 btc contracts. The not so smart group of early bitcoin enthusiasts who held hundreds or even thousands of bitcoins succumbed to the oldest capital market trick: asset base warping thrpugh future contracts.

Its been done on the LIBOR spot price (this rate acts as a benchmark that determines future value of long term investments such as pension returns/actuaries and many other financial vehicles):
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/18/libor-scandal-the-bankers-who-fixed-the-worlds-most-important-number

Its been done on Gold:
https://www.reuters.com/article/gold-fix-idUSL5N0KR2U620140117

Even when OIL has a cartel to ""protect"" suppliers and buyers, warping happens there too:
https://www.nasdaq.com/article/how-crude-oil-traders-manipulate-the-market-cm255276

The list can go on. This is one of the main reasons Satoshi did what he did as he understood that collusion and vovernments and banks have the easiest time to manipulate centralized spot prices, easy as pie and unavoidable.
Problem is he didn't take those factors above + human stupidity into factor.

So bitcoin investor X bought and loaded up on bitcoi  from 2009 and throughout the first couple of years for an average price of lets say $400 and holds 1000. A very respectable sum and gain, even in 2018.

So in late 2017, assuming price of btc is 16k, Investor X, a nobody who spent $400 is now a somebody worth $15,600,000. At this point investor X can be manipulated ao easily into his own FOMO fears, as of now he holds this gigantic compounded investment and after buying the $1mm lambo, he has no idea how to protect the remaining $14,600,000.

Deus Ex Mechina, enter the most lawful casino houses, CBOE and CME.

For investor X to protect his remaining sum of   bitcoin, he has to buy either 1000 contracts in the CBOE or 200 on the CME. Also, he has to buy them at the lowest strike he can get from the exchange since he wants to buy his ""insurance"" as close as he can to his average price: $400, NO PARTY will trade on such a low strike so he settles for the lowest he can get, which os the MOST EXPENSIVE contract. Lets assume he sold a $13000 january contract, which is $1000 under our example spot price.
This means that as a hedger he has to put 43% of 13k on margin for the exchange as collatoral (ill get back to margin) now this is the schtick:

Since investor X has no real money, he has to dilute 43% of 5 bitcoin he owns into fiat and present that as margin. So here we go, he sells 2.15 bitcoin into the market everytime he needs to recover his margin.

Now futures act as a sort of insurance, yet there are rules, if the price flucuates above $25, you get a margin call. You either buy back the shorted contract for the full amount (5 bitcoins) or you continue with your position, dilute another 0.43 btc

8tllaa,1529880267,svet_sedov,1,1,How an absence of technological progress in a country may help Bitcoin?,"After years of isolation an Ethiopian romance with Bitcoin is still in the future. In May 2018 Ethiopian Ministry of Science and Technology's chief announced a partnership with one of the world's major crypto-currencies issuer. However, as far as the Ministry is concerned the block-chain technology must be all about monitoring coffee transit in and out of the country. Officially, crypto-currencies are absent in Ethiopia.

Unlike many of its African counterparts the National Bank of Ethiopia completely disregards existence of this new form of money. Same does the Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority, which is responsible for collecting domestic taxes and custom duties. Because Ethiopia is the largest country in the world without a stock exchange there's, of course, no SEC equivalent existing in Ethiopia.

The only exchange officially recognized in the country is the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX), which was launched by the group of enthusiasts in 2008 and which trades only on five basic agricultural produces - coffee, sesame, beans, wheat and maize. So far local crypto-enthusiasts (if there are any) have been left completely to their own devices, which is, given the excessive level of control presently exercised by Ethiopian government over all other economical and social sectors, may be not such an undesirable outcome after all.

A criminal enterprise operating under the veil of faux legitimacy.","One thing you notice as you look through the wishlists you can buy from for ""earning"" bitcoin, is that they are full of shady names that obviously are made up, like ""Ching Chong"" or ""Beyonce Knowles"" and addresses you can not send to making you cancel the transaction. This indicates that they are heavily utilizing mail forwarders.  One of the big scams I've come to learn from using this service  is when someone receives an order from their wishlist, they will use the order number to get a second shipment with amazon customer support by claiming it never arrived or it arrived broken. I talked to an amazon account specialist after I was shadow banned on amazon and they told me someone requested a refund on my order for that purchase and that my account was flagged for suspicious activity. It has been hell getting my account back up. Also, when you request support, they will go days without replying, but when the admin asks something of you it will be 18 hours before he closes your case instead of the 24 they state. I am owed over 80 dollars from them after they closed the order after the buyer.  This website obtains property for free through fraud through the FEDERAL mail by promising crypto payment and then claiming otherwise about the order. The buyer gets the product twice over and purse takes a cut, racketeering if I ever heard of it. Not to mention if you post your wishlist on that site god knows what kind of crooks are buying your stuff with stolen credit cards. I have informed the FBI, Interpol, the Postal Inspection Service, and I am working on filing a complaint on BBB.

Today it asked me to do it again with a selfie, and kept saying it couldn't read my damn ID. Now it has locked me out for 24 hours in the middle of buying bitcoin in order to send as a payment method. Whats the best alternative to coinbase in buying bitcoin debit card and sending it to a bitcoin address? I'm not very familiar with bitcoin, I don't plan on buying huge amounts and storing it in a bitcoin bank, just $100 dollars worth to get this payment over with. 

I know the U.S. requires verification processes, so im not looking for a way around this. Just looking for a quick way to sign up, verify myself, buy bitcoin with a credit card, and send to a bitcoin address. That's all. To me it seems that coinbase is the only one to make this process simple. Any other alternatives? Even iOS apps?"

Look up any time, anywhere | Fully Functional and looking for feedback. Thanks friends!","Introducing [MyCryptoAlias.com](http://mycryptoalias.com/) v0.9.0 beta! The concept is simple: an online, public address book to store and share any cryptocurrency wallet address.

Step 1: Register an easy to remember alias of your choosing to any crypto wallet address.

Step 2: Any time you need your wallet address, simply look it up on MyCryptoAlias using your selected alias and copy the stored address.

For example, if John Doe wants to make an alias for his Bitcoin wallet on Coinbase, he could register [JohnDoe\_CoinbaseBTC](http://mycryptoalias.com/alias/JohnDoe_CoinbaseBTC) as his alias. When he needs to access or share the address, he can simply look it up using the alias name and copy the original wallet address.

Never send cryptocurrency directly to the alias, as it is just for your reference, and is not tied to the blockchain. You should always send/receive to the stored wallet address

Any and all feedback/bug reporting is appreciated. You can send it here or to [contact@mycryptoalias.com](mailto:contact@mycryptoalias.com) \- Thanks in advance!"

But don't ignore me and steal my funds.

My account has been trading with them, small amounts, with a balance of 880$ USD for quite a while and never had a single issue and now all of a sudden my account is frozen out of the blue and I lost a bunch of trades that were set to auto buy back when the price dipped and they made sure to freeze my account at this point during a coin free fall before the buy back in what I can only imagine was there attempt to try to do the most damage to my trading account in hopes this would encourage me to jump on board and give them everything they wanted, but that will not be happening.

 I received no messages or emails from Poloniex support prior to this happening. I have all there email domains white listed in my email, and I had not logged into the actual website for a while since all my trades were mostly on auto pilot setup using API keys through my trading software ect. 

 This type of customer relations is not only unheard of for any exchange I have used in the last 8 Years, but literally the same customer service I got from Mt.Gox right before they went under, so I felt the need to share.  If they want to demand information and freeze my account this is fine but do not try to steal my funds when I ask to have my account closed. After these recent events and tactics witnessed I no longer trust them and will not be continuing with there exchange as a trading option, and I'm not sure how they think anyone would after being treated like this.

After deciding they were not professional enough to continue using and since I'm verified on Bitstamp, Bitfinex and a couple others already, who have never treated me this way, I informed them I would be closing my account instead and transferring my funds out asap. They acted like everything was fine and then locked me out of my already frozen account and have not responded to my support requests for over a month now. Yet they respond instantly to any other support requests and are clearly ignoring me now that I do not want to continue using there exchange. 

This type of customer service and support for an account that is over 2 years old with them is appalling. I'm just glad I recently transferred the bulk of my account balances out prior to this happening.

I would highly recommend if you use [Poloniex.com](https://Poloniex.com) to be very weary of them as they do not care how long you have been with them when the time comes you decide to move on they will likely try to rob you also.

I have already taken other legal steps at this point in time, and am posting this for the purpose of making sure other have a fare warning of my experience. I will attach my support ticket conversation that has been a single reply from support and now 30+ Days of being ignored, without even an update to say there still working on it or if my case was passed to appropriate department as they claimed.

On 20 Jun, 2018 (Hong Kong time), OKEx officially launches the Digital Asset Exchange Open Partnership Program and begins the recruitment of “OK Partners”. By sharing the fruits of OKEx's matching system, counter system, cold wallet, hot wallet, clearing system, multilingual customer support, as well as global know-your-customer and anti-laundering system cultivated for years with our OK Partners, the program is set to nurture a new generation of digital asset exchanges characterized by high autonomy, efficiency and transparency. Aspiring teams who aim to establish their own digital asset exchanges, only need to provide their domain names, logos, operation force, and to focus on the management and operations of the exchange. OKEx's global technical team, on the other hand, will provide R&amp;D and system maintenance supports to the teams, who will share the high liquidity and advanced trading experience offered by the world-leading digital asset exchange.

The 1st phase of the program offers 100 places for participating teams. Applicants are required to deposit 500,000 OKB in their accounts, excluding the amount locked for Designated Merchant, New Listing Vote, and Prime Investors. The ideal candidates for OK Partners should possess solid industry experience, quest for service excellence, and strong industry influence. The 1st phase is expected to go online in late July. Interested parties should submit their contact person's name and phone number as well as team description to [okbd@okex.com](mailto:okbd@okex.com) for application."

The halving comes every 4 years, therefore it seems that next halving would be 2021.

To meet minimum maintenance fee for running such huge mining factory, I guess bitcoin price also should be doubled as its reward halves at next halving.

With this simple mathematics, I think Bitcoin price should go 2\~3k in upcoming years.

Why do so many of us do that? It seems like a theme many of us go through. It's like I was defending my position, which was that I had missed out. It's some kind of cognitive dissonance that's hard to overcome if you're not curious enough, thankfully I became curious enough as i saw the price climb day after day.

I've been interested in stocks and economics for years and taught myself through podcasts and audiobooks from the likes of Warren Buffett and people with similar mindsets. And when something challenges your view of the world, you fight back. I think a lot of people fight back, and if you're not curious enough to want to keep learning about the world, you'll keep fighting.

I'm in to bitcoin for the same reason everyone else is. Monetary sovereignty, sound money, revolutionary technology and of course to be rewarded for seeing something that people who are not curious enough can't see.

Stay strong friends. And most importantly, stay curious!"

1. I sell. Right now despite the huge crash in my portfolio since my fomo buy, I only have unrealized losses, which  would only materialize if I convert into fiat. 
  The same would be true if i was up 1000%. The gain would only mean anything if i actually cashed it out.
2. The market stays bearish for a long time. It's not that big a deal if we crash to zero and back again in a time frame similar to 2014. Even in the most bullish environment I'm not expecting to become rich overnight. The crypto millionaires are rich because they either believed in the underlying tech or simply forgot about their investment for extended periods of time (5+ years). There's many idiots who got in at sub 1$ and have nothing to show for it. 
 That being said, if the crypto market takes 20-30 years to recover, I'd be pretty pissed, since that would become dead money that could have been put to better use elsewhere (getting a down payment so I can try my hand on the real estate casino, getting in on the Nasdaq, etc). 
3. The market goes to 0. Pretty self-explanatory. Satoshi turns out to be Rothchild in disguise of something and Bitcoin crashes to nothing and I lose all my money. Definitely possible, but highly unlikely. At the very least, even if bitcoin has no other use case, it's still a good hedge against traditional assets. 
In addition, I expect big corporations to start printing their own money (AMZN coin anyone?). There's no good reason they shouldn't. They can raise money from across the world with no accountability. Once that happens the whole market will boom again. 
My advice to to everyone on this sub and to myself: stop looking at the charts and come back in 2 years. "

To me bitcoin is an idea with great potential, it is of course in a coarse sense a crypographic vault which is part of a network which is in itself self sustaining/self verifying and nothing escapes the eye of the network in a malicious way. Of course this is the idea of a safe blockchain. 

Seems simple but put this idea into our current world going through huge technological advancements and with an upheaval in the geopolitical image, with extremities showing in the form of of the Trumpet and the rest of the political world not finding common footing and keeping this machine of excess for the few, and less for the many. The pyramid defies gravity, money is funneled upwards, there is no trickle down effect. Borders have never been clearer and we forget who we are in the hate to others. 

There has got to be something that tips the scales and I don't know what it takes, but bitcoin to me, is not just a drop in the pond, not if it gains traction and the core idea about it is developed and integrated. It is definitely not a far fetched idea because it is timely, it is a pervasive idea in a corrupt world and we might sink or float on this but as long as it gives a good fight against the monopolised world and at the same time induces the idea that there is much to be improved then even that fight, which I think it is going through is a battle to harden the will of those who believe in btc or simply many of the use cases of blockchain."

But here's my understanding as to why  price can continue falling, yet how miners may still be compelled to mine because it will still be profitable for them to do so.

We were told Bitcoin's price can't fall under the price of mining a Bitcoin, that it has a floor. But then why is it falling through the floor?

My understanding is that the software adjusts the difficulty of mining the next coin to control the pace/progress of mining coins. The more powerful the machines are used to mine, the greater the level of difficulty set by the Bitcoin software to mine the next coin. 

In economics, a business will not pursue an activity if the profit is less than the cost of production. But it seems lately that the (lack of) demand for Bitcoin is lowering the price. So then, competition to mine the next coins is drawing back which will lead to the software adjusting the difficulty level to be more easy. 

Whichever miners are willing to wait it out for competing miners to drop out 1st will receive the spoils of successfully mining coins at a profit because the cost to do so will be less due to the lack of competition."

8tr9rz,1529939456,corsicanainvestor,0,4,Bitcoin Theft From Calling Scam Ledger Wallet Customer Support Telephone Number On Google Search Engine,"      I'm posting this to warn others about dangers on the Internet.  I had about two-thirds of all my investments in Bitcoin.  I was unaware of all the scammers on the Internet until one stole the Bitcoins from my Coinbase account.  Ledger Wallet imposed a mandatory upgrade to their hardware wallet for cryptocurrencies.  When I was following the online instructions, I was locked out of MyEtherWallet with 'Error Code 5' and didn't find the instructions on how to get around this until April 1st.  They were on the MyEtherWallet website and I could go on my account after following those instructions to find my ERC20 tokens. 
         Be aware that Ledger Wallet in Paris, France has no telephone support anywhere in the world.  All the listings for toll-free numbers listed on Google and other search engines are to scammers.  The following warning was posted on the Ledger Wallet Twitter Timeline March 1st, but I didn't notice it until after the theft of my Bitcoins on 3-8-18.  There is no such warning on the Ledger Wallet website which would have prevented me from falling for this scam. 

[Ledger‏Verified account @LedgerHQ](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ)📷 [Mar 1](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ/status/969171921916121088)  WARNING: Ledger does NOT provide customer support over the phone. Beware the scammers impersonating the Ledger support team by using 1-888-XXXX (or others) phone numbers. Don’t give control of your computer to strangers and NEVER reveal your 24 words to anyone!    

Never search for customer support numbers on search engines.  These are unverified listings.  If a company lists no telephone support number on its real website, it means they have no telephone support and they are not required to with cryptocurrencies.  Numerous customer support scams have telephone numbers which show up on search engines.  You should never call these numbers as you will be in contact with criminals.  You can type the number itself into the search bar and will often find numerous listings as the same number is being used to impersonate customer service for more than one company.  The scammer I called wanted to remote access my computer and I allowed him to do this as I thought he worked for Ledger Wallet without knowing Google doesn't verify the telephone numbers on their search engines.  It showed up on the screen that several bugs were found on the computer which needed to be removed.  The scammer said my Bitcoins needed to be moved off my Ledger Bitcoin Wallet for my own security while he was removing the bugs he pretended to have found.  He suggested I move them onto Coinbase which I did.  When he was done with his pretend computer servicing, he said I should stay off the computer for the next twelve hours.  The next morning I went onto the Coinbase account and found the Bitcoins were gone.  They had been sent to anonymous Bitcoin addresses and could not be recovered.    

I reported this sad story to the Palm Beach Research Group.  Their online educational materials introduced me to cryptocurrency investing, but they haven't included enough warnings for novice investors.  I received this message in response, but have omitted names as I don't have permission to post them.    

I'm part of     's team and I help manage his editorial content and social media presence. We're very sorry to hear about your situation.      read your notes and passed them along directly to        . The team also passed along your notes to Palm Beach Research Group's Customer Service division. Even though what you went through is awful, we're grateful to you for sharing your experience with us; right now, we're doing exactly as you advised: looking into providing additional warnings, advice, and how-to guides for spotting and avoiding the more insidious and subtle scams that are out there. That content should be coming out soon, I am told. Again, what happened to you was horrible, but with any luck we'll be able to help prevent something like that from happening to other subscribers. Thank you.    

It's gratifying to know others will benefit  from my mistakes, but I haven't found anyone who wants to restore the Bitcoins I lost.  I will provide my new Trezor Wallet Bitcoin address which has a zero balance at the time of this posting.  I would deeply appreciate any donations to help restore the 5.45130674 Bitcoins I had on my Ledger Wallet prior to the theft.  Please only donate if you are wealthy and have Bitcoins to spare as I will consider any Bitcoin I receive a gift.  It would help me survive this dreadful ordeal to recover the funds I lost and know I prevented others from losing much larger sums.  Feel free to pass this post on to anyone you know who owns Bitcoin.  Any donation will help.

                                                             3Hq4YJu9wfr8mLbx9ePQc79nKfN7mMUoex    

I have verified this address is the same one which appears on the screen of my Trezor hardware wallet and my computer screen.  It's important to make sure these addresses are the same when you receive funds.  The address above can only receive Bitcoin.  You can test this address by sending a tiny amount of Bitcoin and posting a comment for corsicanainvestor on reddit.  I will reply as soon as I see the comment to verify the amount received and validate this Bitcoin address.  Please only send a large amount after I respond to your comment to be safe.   I will post my new Bitcoin balance as a comment under this post so readers will know when my funds have been restored.

Here's part of a message I received from customer service at MyEtherWallet.  It contains important warnings about how to avoid dangers on the Internet.    

I'm sorry for all you've been through. It seems that those funds may just be lost forever, but I can't help but hold onto hope that maybe you'll get some sort of reimbursement for all the trouble and heartache you've had. I really do wish you the best in all of this. Whenever you are curious about anything, feel free to reach out to me and I'd be happy to try and point you in the right directions, for future reference. This crypto world is lacking in decent support, so we at MEW try to help anyone who needs questions answered, even if it is beyond our actual range of job coverage. Whatever information I have on security, I'm happy to help.    

The phishers and scammers are on the loose! Protect yourself by installing [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn) or [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) or [Cryptonite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige). Never enter your private information on ANY website without verifying it is the correct website. If you give them your private key, they can &amp; will steal ALL YOUR COINS.  - MyEtherWallet    

I have added  the above mentioned Google Chrome extensions to my Google Chrome browser to protect myself from phishing websites.  They look very similar to the websites created by legitimate companies, but are run by criminals who want to trick you into providing private information so they can steal your funds.  EAL stands for EtherAddressLookup and can be found on the Google search engine in the Chrome Web Store.  MetaMask and Cryptonite by MetaCert can also be found on the Google search engine in the Chrome Web Store and I have all three.    

Here's a list of more warnings I've come up with while learning about cryptocurrency theft.  It's important to warn others about Internet dangers to prevent scams.  These warnings came at a high price to me, but I want others to benefit from my mistakes.  I hope and pray my Bitcoins will be restored through donations from grateful readers.

1. Only call a number for customer service listed on a company's real website.  Never trust listings from search engines and be certain you are on the real website and not a phishing site.  The Google Chrome extensions you need to avoid phishing sites are mentioned in the conversation I had with a customer service representative at MyEtherWallet.
2. Never allow anyone you don't trust to have your private keys to MyEtherWallet or anywhere else your funds are kept as they can and will steal all your funds.
3. Never allow a stranger to remote access your computer even if a listing on the Internet appears legitimate.  This is something scammers want to do so they can come back later to steal your funds.
4. Be aware there are multiple ways the professional thieves have devised to steal your funds.  Never trust an email is from who it appears to be from.  If there is personal account information requested, never provide it.  It's very dangerous to click on links in suspicious emails.  You could be downloading malware or visiting a phishing site.
5. Never trust a caller on the telephone is who they claim to be.  Anyone who claims to work for a legitimate company and asks for sensitive personal information likely wants to steal from you and will tell you a pack of lies to put you in an urgent state of mind.
6. Never reveal your 24 word phrase to a cryptocurrency wallet to anyone.  Keep a record of it offline where you know it's safe and never take a photograph of it or put it into an email.  Those 24 words could be used to clone your wallet and steal your funds.
7. Trezor Wallet is recommended over Ledger Wallet as many Ledger Wallet customers have had unresolved issues due to a mandatory upgrade.  This presumed upgrade caused me to lose all my Bitcoins which could have been prevented if the March 1st Twitter Warning had been posted on the Ledger Wallet website.  Even after reporting this theft to the Ledger Wallet online support people, there is still no warning on the Ledger Wallet website regarding their telephone impersonators.  This was a negligent omission as this could have been copied and pasted from the Twitter Timeline March 1st and spared me this nightmare.  A warning about a security threat should not be reserved for the Ledger Wallet Twitter followers.
8. Avoid using cryptocurrencies to make purchases online as the transactions are irreversible and you cannot dispute the charges as you can with a credit card.
9. Always be wary on the Internet and never take posts at face value.  They may not have been made by the people they are pretending to be.  The Internet is a dangerous place filled with scam artists.
10. If a company has no telephone support number to call listed on their real website, it means they don't have telephone support.  Do not look up these numbers on search engines as this is how you will come in contact with criminals who want to steal your funds.
11. Never use a hardware wallet which has already been initialized and never order one advertised as being used.  People have lost their life savings by purchasing Ledger Wallets on ebay which have scratch off cards to reveal their 24 word phrase.  This was not packaged that way by the manufacturer.  It was tampered with and repackaged by someone who wants to steal your funds.
12. Beware of scams around every corner of the Internet and never assume postings are legitimate.  They could be made by criminals impersonating real customer support people you cannot call on the telephone or expect them to make any response to your online support requests on their own website.  It's a sad world of thieves and scammers on the Internet and it's easy to fall into their traps.  The lack of decent customer service in the cryptocurrency sphere has created a dangerous place for anyone who hasn't been warned about the extent that Internet thieves will trick and deceive their victims into thinking they want to help solve problems the company they pretend to represent cannot solve for you as they have no real telephone customer service and their online customer service is so poor that many see their requests for assistance never responded to.

FEEL FREE TO SHARE THIS POST ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND YOUTUBE.  YOU CAN COPY AND PASTE THE TEXT OR USE A LINK TO CORSICANAINVESTOR ON REDDIT WITH YOUR OWN DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I'VE POSTED.  MANY OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS I USED TO WATCH BEFORE THE INCIDENT I NO LONGER WATCH AS IT'S TOO PAINFUL TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF BITCOIN SINCE MINE WERE STOLEN.  I'VE OFTEN WISHED I COULD GET BACK THAT DAY AND DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY AS I ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN WITH MY OWN POOR JUDGMENT, BUT THIS PERSONAL TRAGEDY CAN TURN INTO SOMETHING GOOD WITH YOUR HELP. 

SHARING THIS POST ANYWHERE YOU THINK PEOPLE WOULD HAVE INTEREST IN IT WOULD HELP GET THESE WARNINGS OUT TO A LARGE AUDIENCE AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS ENOUGH WEALTH IN THE CRYPTOSPHERE THAT SOME WEALTHY BITCOIN HOLDERS WOULD BE GLAD TO COVER MY LOSSES IN EXCHANGE FOR MY GOOD ADVICE ON WHAT TO DO TO PROTECT YOUR CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND OTHER FUNDS.  PLEASE DON'T FORGET BIG NAMES SUCH AS VITALIK BUTERIN AND ROGER VER WHO BOTH HAVE A VERY LARGE FOLLOWING ON TWITTER.  ANYONE WHO KNOWS THEM ON TWITTER CAN BRING THIS TO THEIR ATTENTION TO SHARE WITH THEIR OTHER FOLLOWERS. THERE MAY BE PEOPLE WITH LARGER FOLLOWINGS WHOSE NAMES I'M LESS FAMILIAR WITH, BUT I WILL LEAVE IT TO MY REDDIT READERS TO SEE THAT THESE IMPORTANT WARNINGS ARE SHARED WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.  IF EVERYONE KNEW BETTER THAN TO FALL FOR THESE SCAMS, THEY WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO GO ON FOR YEARS.

I HAVE DOCUMENTED THIS CRIME WITH COINBASE EMAILS I SAW AFTER ALL THE BITCOINS HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM MY COINBASE ACCOUNT.  I  WILL COPY AND PASTE THE EVIDENCE INTO A COMMENT UNDER THIS POST.  ONCE I ALLOWED THE SCAMMER TO REMOTE ACCESS THE COMPUTER AND CONVINCE ME TO STAY OFFLINE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS, HE WAS ABLE TO GO ON THE COINBASE ACCOUNT AND IMPERSONATE ME.  THE AMOUNTS SENT TO THE SCAMMER'S BITCOIN ADDRESSES ADD UP TO THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF BITCOINS I HAD ON MY LEDGER WALLET PRIOR TO THE THEFT, BUT DUE TO FEES THE NUMBERS DIFFER AFTER 5.45 BITCOINS."

A cryptocurrency wallet (or crypto wallet), is like a bank account where you can store, receive, and transfer your cryptocurrency to another account — you can even purchase something with your cryptocurrency through the wallet! A crypto wallet allows you to conveniently and securely manage your cryptocurrencies, for both storage and trading purposes.

In general, there are 5 types of cryptocurrency wallets.

### 1. Hardware Wallet

Hardware wallet is known as the best crypto wallet in terms of security. The hardware wallet is essentially the same as traditional wallets, but in a form of a digital device to operate your account. Despite the security it can provide, its expensive price often hinders people from purchasing hardware wallets.

### 2. Online Wallet

Online wallet is the most common type of wallet as it is cheap, easy to use, and accessible from virtually any device — so long as you are connected to the internet. You can also manage multiple currencies at a time and use VPN for further privacy. Online wallet is attractive to the majority because of its speed, ease of access, and cheap price.

### 3. Mobile Wallet

Mobile wallet works similarly as online wallet does, except that it only works on mobile devices. You can get cryptocurrencies wallet apps from Google Play store or Apps store. The main catches for mobile wallet are their speed and ease of access, plus its QR code scanning features. However, be sure that you use well-known mobile crypto wallet — there are some reports on Reddit about fraudulent apps that could steal your bitcoin.

### 4. Desktop Wallet

Desktop Wallet minimizes your risk of getting hacked as you don’t need an internet connection to operate a desktop wallet. With a desktop wallet, nothing will be stored online — your cryptocurrency holdings and your private keys are securely kept in your device. However, your information is not free of human error (e.g. accidental deletion) and computer viruses. Desktop Wallet is usually free.

### 5. Paper Wallet

Paper Wallet might sound so old-fashioned, but it is also one of the most secure ways to store your cryptocurrencies. You will get the printed version of your public and private key, and you’ll need to complete the key for every transaction you make. There is almost no risk of getting hacked since it does not use any digital device to store your cryptocurrencies and no private keys are stored on third-party servers.

### Top 7 Best Cryptocurrency Wallets

There are numerous crypto wallets out there, but we'd love to share with you the 7 best wallets, according to our own research. Since cryptocurrencies are not regulated by any law of any country in the world, you need to be very careful in choosing your crypto wallet. It's a necessary investment that you take time to ensure that the crypto wallet you are going to use is not just convenient, but more importantly, secure.

**1. Ledger Nano S**

**2. Ledger Blue**

**3. Coinpayments**

Then today I tried to make a purchase, but my exchange told me my bank didn't authorize the sale. Tried another exchange and had the same thing.

Steps:

* Be a big miner who dislikes bitcoin and LN (bitmain) 
* Open a lightning hub and connect to all the other big hubs with little to no fees, get a large set of others routing through your node
* Wait until the mem pool is congested
* Close the channel with an old channel state that makes you money.  Since you are a miner, put a huge fee on it (maybe even more than half of the potential gain). Not only does it make it likely the invalid channel state will be accepted by miners, there is a % of hash power owned chance the fee will go back to yourself anyway.  Also, use accelerator services to hide the fact there are other rewards for miners to accept the old channel state as well.

Am I wrong in thinking that watch towers would not help here?  I can't of anyway to identify bad nodes like this, once they act badly they can be cut off of the network.  For us to really defend against this, don't nodes have to become watch towers and reject old channel updates?  If we modify node software to filter old channel states that will open up some other attack vectors maybe, and we can't make all nodes do it so it would be flawed in the same way 0-conf's are.

8tx049,1529986091,Sneakybobo,0,18,r/bitcoin survey: How miserable are you ?,"The [Bitcoin Misery Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-misery-index.asp) (BMI) incorporates the percentage of winning trades to total trades, as well as volatility. It shows a value of 0 to 100. Since we do not have access to exchanges insider information, we cannot measure BMI directly. However we can survey bitcoin hodlers about they own personnal misery.

Hence I hereby madeup the Personnal Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI_p) : If you sold your bitcoin now, what would be your gain or loss percentage? It can be expressed as

BMI_p == **bprice** * (**bhodl** / **$buy**) - 1

where **$buy** is the fiat you spent to buy the bitcoin you currently hodl, **bhodl** is the amount of bitcoin you currently hodl, and **bprice** is the current bitcoin price in the same fiat currency.

For example, if you bought 0.5 bitcoin at 1K, and 0.3 bitcoin at 14K, you'd have bought **bhodl** == 0.5+0.3 == 0.8 bitcoin for **$buy** == (1000 * 0.5) + (14,000 * 0.3) == 500 + 4200 == 4700$. Considering bitcoin is now worth 6200$, your BMI_p == 6200 * (0.8 / 4700) - 1 == 5.53%. In other words if you sold your bitcoin now you'd had gain 5.53% of your investment.

Since BMI_p is a percentage it can be revealed without revealing your **$buy** nor your **bhodl**.

Please upvote my comment that corresponds to your BMI_p: &lt;-60%, ]-60%, -50%], ]-50%, -40%], ]-40%, -30%], ]-30%, -20%], ]-20%, -10%], ]-10%, 0[, ]0, 10%[, [10%, 20%[, [20%, 30%[, [30%, 40%[, [40%, 50%[, [50%, 60%[, &gt;60%

I'll post an histogram of the results when I'll judge the number of respondents stabilized."

I like to think of this moment as when Laszlo bought his pizzas. Ever since, bitcoin has grown in value and all of it's growth has been organic and from the grass roots.

Why did Jercos accept 10000 magic internet coins from Laszlo?  Was it because he thought he could later trade them in for more value? or hold until moon for lambos? The ironic thing is that he could probably buy dozens of lambos today if he wanted to. At the time however, they were completely worthless with literally no real life users. People like Jercos supported bitcoin in it's infancy because it represented a completely new idea of money and one that is far superior. The problems that we are dealing with in bitcoin today are largely due to it's infancy; bitcoin and crypto is still too young and adoption is still growing. You can't expect bitcoin to take over the global financial market in under 10 years starting at 0 users. 

People like Jercos and Laszlo supported bitcoin when it had no monetary value because it represented an idea of decentralization, financial freedom and separation of money and state. The early supporters and innovators of bitcoin HODLed because they understood what bitcoin represents, what it could be and that any technical inadequacies can be later improved upon. This is reason why we have segwit, lightning network, hardware wallets and numerous new inventions and add ons.

The biggest driver behind bitcoin's success is not the protocol itself but rather what it represents. Bitcoin is an idea, the real adoption is a psychological one. The real support levels of bitcoin are the innovators who are busy creating their idea of what bitcoin could be and the true believers who support bitcoin not for financial gain but rather because they are boycotting their current system. They are not going anywhere and neither is bitcoin. "

On June the 19th a hacker was able to intrude in my Google account.
1. He stole passwords from ""Google Auto Sign-in"", a tool I use to automatically sign-in to websites using stored credentials
2. downloaded photos of me and of my passport from Google drive
3. arranged these pictures with Photoshop or some other photo editing program to make a photomontage showing me holding my passport
4. entered in my Bittrex support account and submitted a ticket to disable 2FA security on my account
5. put a rule in my gmail to filter all messages from Bittrex and send them directly into the trash bin. 
6. At the request of identity verification he just posted 2 photomontages one showing me holding a paper sheet reading ""bittrex 19.06.2018 Please disable 2FA"" and another one showing me holding my passport. 

In only 25 hours and 12 minutes the Bittrex agent gave him green light to disable 2FA, while I couldn't see any email from support, cause I don't check trash bin of my gmail so often.
He immediately entered in my Bittrex account where I had crypto currency for about 40000 USD value. 
He withdrew all my funds to his crypto currency addresses.
Despite the very suspicious activity the Bittrex support agent didn't lock withdrawals up nor even put them on hold as it's usual after 2FA disabling. 
The suspicious signs were:
1.   IP address of a location on the other side of the globe respect to my usual login site
2.   Request to disable 2FA security without a motivation
3.   two low quality photomontages which anyone can easily realize coming from one single original. Indeed only centering, contrast and background color were changed to mimic two different photos. 

Below I report the whole emails exchange between the hacker and the Bittrex support agent

\- Quantative easing throwing trillions into American stocks (mother bubble)

\- Government bond creation (debt) = money creation out of thin air, inflating your fiat

\- pumping real estate with debt, money that banks churn out of thin air

\- pumping (shitty) altcoins to insane levels with altcoin owner Bitcoins (why it's correlated)

and the list goes on and on..

...even if Tethers weren't backed by fiat it's still viable if we are to have some pairity with the hyperinflation happening in fiat.

Question is .. are we to have special rules that BTC can't be touched by fiat inflation (but only savings?)"

Perhaps not the right place to post this, but I'm not sure. Help would be really appreciated.

I'm trying to buy a house with Bitcoin-related funds, however they are referring me to a bitcoin 'audit company' known as elliptic, who think that the cost will be around 15,000 GBP (around 20,000 USD) simply to do an audit. That's an additional \~8&amp;#37; fee on the house

This seems extremely steep. Is this really what is absolutely required to buy a house with bitcoin-based funds? It seems like they just want to do the same KYC stuff that exchanges to, but at a 15,000 GBP price tag?! 

I understand KYC is absolutely required when doing something like purchasing property. But the audit cost seems a little crazy.

Something seems wrong here. If I'm wrong, I suppose I have no choice but to throw that money away...but I'd like to avoid it if possible..."

1. is opening a channel expected to be a rare event - maybe i open channels and settle them annually or something?  maybe never even settle them?
2. to diversify/expand routing, i'm far better off opening 8-10 channels rather than 1-2, correct?  i assume at some point a large number of open channels also becomes algorithmically problematic in determining best route?
3. i have a pretty small/vague understanding of the liquidity as some abacus model, essentially i need to fund a channel a nontrivial amount to get some real use out of though however - 100 minimum if not 1000 to make my life simpler, is this a correct understanding?
4. given high on chain fees, does this approach not simply eliminate the potential use case of extending btc to financially excluded participants?  ie. no land line telco infrastructure in parts of africa was built - it was simply skipped with the evolution of mobile phones.  as low fees (LN) requires an on-chain BTC wallet and acquisition of some BTC to participate at all, mobile USD banking for someone living on $2 is fully eliminated, is it not?
5. or perhaps this person can participate by acquiring something with cheap on-chain fees and opening a LN with that; but i'm confused how this works.  ie. i send someone $20 in doge, they open an LN wallet with it, aaand...  at this point i'm confused as to how some crypto/crypto conversion might actually work and settle properly (although maybe this is not a real potential case/use??)

thanks."

First step was place some coins in my wallet. (3 config)

Second, I openend a channel, to ACINQ, and funded the channel. (3 config)

First test was than a LN Payment. I used Bitrefill for top-up my phone. In a few seconds, payment accepted and phone Top-up. I used my channel to ACINQ, no channel to bitrefill.

Second test, receiving using LN. I decided for a withdraw from https://www.moneni.com/. Again using the standard channel. 

You only fill in the amount, and description, the wallet created the invoice, and just copy and paste. The payment request is than valid for 2 days.

After a hr, I decided for a new test, and made a new invoice, same amount, and again, valid for 2 days, and worked fine.

My question is:

**Is there a problem for the wallet, or the LN network, if I use the same invoice, multiple times?**

After I received the payment, the wallet shows me that there was a LN payment, and gives the description from the payment.

What will happen if I use the same invoice, 2 - 10 - 20 - … times in the next 2 days?

Will that give a problem for the wallet, and/or can that give a problem for the LN network?

Graph of all the existing channels, gets bigger every day so it looks promising. My concern here however is that it is highly unpractical to have all the money allocated in multiple channels because people need to use the money and not everyone has excess money to leave it laying around in multiple channels. So the unevitable outcome is that people will be creating fewest channels possible with fewest hops to other people to sustain their money liquidity. Emergence of some 'hot' spots is already to be seen in current lightning network graph. Arent this new 'hot' spots or channel 'hubs' exact same centralisation we are trying to fight in the first place? We all are already using lightning network in fiat ... by having channel opened with the bank which then sends money further for some fee. How is bitcoin lightning network differnent from this?

I thought maybe people will be actually incentivised to have money allocated in channels as they would get paid some fee when others would use them as vertex point. This could reduce the centralisation, but the topology of the lightning network is unclear and could very well end as the system we are currently having with fiat.

In fact, because of the additional witness data in each transaction, using Segwit transactions, we actually get less transactions per block.  

Show me exactly how this thought is wrong.  Thanks."

It says ""The Bank of Ghana wishes to notify the general public that these activities in digital currency are currently not licensed under the Payments System Act 2003 (Act 662) . . . The public is therefore strongly encouraged to do business with only institutions licensed by the Bank of Ghana to ensure that such transactions fall under our regulatory purview"".

Although this statement just reinforces the notion that digital currencies are currently unregulated in Ghana, overzealous local officials may also interpret it as a hint on the illicit nature of all crypto-related assets. For a country, which has consistently spent its resources to establish itself as the African technological leader, this resolution can do more harm than good. Among other negative consequences it might result in unnecessary legal restrictions and drive Bitcoin underground.

political climate: marginally friendly;
economic climate: moderately friendly;
regions to focus: locally, Sub-Saharan Africa;
industries to focus: e-commerce, media, mobile applications, e-job, marketplaces, entertainment, FinTech, tourism, solar, bio-tech;

stimulus: expanding economy (GDP growth rate about 6%), many new market opportunities, large young population, access to qualify pool of local coders and talents from neighboring countries, potential to became one of major African's technological hubs.
opportunities: many;
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): not regulated (moderately negative).

*About Me*

I'm 22 half brazilain half korean, been hacking since sophomore year of high school. We found the codes to travel back in time on accident by hacking a data center in Suriname. `PRO TIP ITS NOT A DATACENTER` 

This message is being digitally sent from the year 2095.  Ironically I work at Outback Steakhouse part time in Virginia but I live in the bali.   


*How Time Traveling Works*

It's a little long to explain but it works kinda this; The Spirit Of Humanity or life is like an electrical current, laid out on a complex electrical grid, and it's possible to build a micro controller for you to interact with the ""grid"". 

Current science and math is a little short of the stick, because we can only measure and study whats 1) Here on Earth 2) With what we have. 

I'm little short on time funny enough, because time is in fact ""monitored"" We aren't the first ones to figure out how to get out of the maze..Think of it as the quality assurance department. 

*The World*  
Korea because unified, reading long passages of text becomes utterly annoying. China(Eurasia) is like America after WWII thanks to the One Belt Initiative. America ain't no joke, but it's no China. Thanks to climate change new jobs opened up; like you can get paid 13/hr to hunt for parts and equipment in New York. Or, if you want to brave Phoenix you could get paid double. It's about 225 right now. 

People including those within college don't *need* to read books. Seriously, theirs so much information that it's pointless to read. Most people learn by ""gisting"" which is getting the bare information needed to do the job. 

Renting is pretty chill, I don't need a house because we all travel all the time. Seriously, the time it takes to go from one side of the planet to the next is like a bus ticket. Though why take the bus when you can just fly their yourself? (Ford came out with the Mustang Platinum 7K. It's self driving, flightless, and I can answer emails during the drive. Has an onboard computer which you can easily download tinder ;-) (which speaking of dating omg its annoying)

Smartphones are nearly obsolete. It's like blockbuster? In my timeline, as everyone has a digital assistant. A DA does all that a smartphone does and more. It combines having a personal assistant and smartphone into a neat package. You can also mate with it to have kids if that's your thing. 

Racism has shifted towards discrimination based on status. Ya some people are still bias against color of the skin, but its more about whats in your wallet. It's a huge problem to be honest..You could lose your job just because you don't have a Versace street bike.

*Corporate Warfare*

&gt;The rise of corporate influence in governments rise until the Second Great Recession hits and everyone gets really really really upset. People don't trust anyone anymore and civil war nearly breaks out, but is stopped thanks to the proposal of a decentralized government

Having a single bitcoin in my life is like discovering an oil field. Now its being touted as digital gold..kek try digital oil!  
I don't want to spoil the fun and tell you prices ;) but I will say hodl.  Bitcoin is the dinosaur...so imagine how much money having a real dinosaur would be in today's times.   


*The Woolies*

In the future some of you guys will be regarded as the ""woolies"" A meme for the smart nerds who's invested into bitcoin; the woolly mammoths are the people who's mega rich. They bought and held bitcoin for **years** &amp; that's pretty much unheard of.    
I think its around 5&amp;#37; from 2019 held. A lot of its value increased just due to a decrease in supply. The earthquake that struck California and parts of Canada did a 313&amp;#37; increase. That's not even including what happened in Maimi!

Anyways the woolies are new class of rich, they got so much money they don't know what to do with it. Some invest, some buy more stuff, others live a simple life. Really its due to bitcoin that we see the first trillionaire. Anyways..hodl on even during dismal times..  


ps:

Nowadays people are fighting and arguing over gun rights...you here the saying ""whats a gun gonna to do to a drone?"" well in our time its ""whats a drone gonna do to the hackers?"" ;)

Hey guys, in this video we're discussing the Bitcoin and ICO OTC (Over the Counter) markets. 

For traders in the $250K+ category, trading OTC is most likely the preferred option. OTC might be institutions, private traders, brokers, etc. This not only allows a layer of security for their buys, but allows them to bypass the regulations put in place by traditional exchanges.

8u6foz,1530071230,r2pleasent,0,3,Just Added Coinbase Commerce to my Website!,"I know Coinbase gets a lot of hate sometimes on Reddit, but the new ""Coinbase Commerce"" application has been a godsend for our website.  We previously used some custom made application that would forward transactions to a middle address, then it would collect a fee and send the remainder to our address.  Aside from being incredibly inefficient (3 transactions instead of 1 for each order), it was also pointlessly expensive.  About 0.0002 per transaction, which adds up fast on small orders.

About a month ago Coinbase Commerce introduced a plug and play checkout that allows us to collect our orders in BTC  with little friction whatsoever.  The amounts are stored on basically a separate Coinbase wallet that we can withdraw from at any time.  The interface is familiar since it's basically just Coinbase, and the fees are incredibly reasonable (1&amp;#37; I believe).  This means we don't get screwed on smaller transactions.  We sell digital gaming items like OSRS Gold, CSGO Keys, etc. so many of our customers are only spending $5 USD or so at a time.

Link: [https://commerce.coinbase.com/](https://commerce.coinbase.com/)

Before we were using Bitpay, and I made a post here about them clearing double spend transactions on our site, which ended with us losing some money.  They replied that we should have waited for X confirmations, but that was difficult for our agents to track in the backend of our website.  Interestingly, only a few days later Bitpay shut down our merchant account and told us our business model was ""too high risk"".  Our website is [R2Pleasent.com](https://r2pleasent.com/).  We had been operating on Bitpay for about 2 years prior to that shut down.  Really convenient timing!

Anyways, that's about it, I just hope any of you that are running an e-commerce style store check out Coinbase commerce.  We've tried a few of the merchant solutions out there, and this is by far the best of them all."

8u7bzi,1530080859,xxxsdpsn,1,5,Questions about transfers. Fees and speed.,"I've been using kucoin and transfers are cheap but slow, I kinda understand how it works.

But...

If I want to make BTC transactions in less than 20 minutes would it be faster to use an electrum wallet and choose next block for transfer or use a wallet on blockchain.info and  put in a manual fee of like 100 sato/bytes.


So the lower the fees the slower the transfer, but does that mean the hire the fees the faster the transfer?

So even if blockchain.info is only recommending i do 10 and put in 100 sato/bytes ill be faster in transferring then 10?



If I wanted to transfer 100$ in btc to an exchange, what would be the fastest way to transfer? what wallet/fee would I want to use for max transfer speed?"

8u7gk5,1530082384,balmofgilead,0,3,A Secure Offline Bitcoin Payment System,"A paper titled Secure Wallet-Assisted Offline Bitcoin Payments with Double-Spender Revocation (https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/inst-infsec/system-security-group-dam/research/publications/pub2017/asia084.pdf) was published a while ago. The paper proposes the first solution for secure Bitcoin offline payments using an offline wallet with several novel security mechanisms to prevent double-spending and to verify the coin validity in offline setting.

There are three phases:

1. Online Bitcoin preloading.

2. Offline Bitcoin payment.

3. Online redemption of coins and revocation of double spending attacks.

&gt; In the first phase, the payer X generates pre-loading transaction τl (step 1) that transfers some bitcoins from her standard Bitcoin account x to the offline wallet’s account w, so that the balance of w becomes positive. This is done by means of standard online Bitcoin transaction, for which the network generates n-transaction confirmation n -Tl. 

&gt; In the second phase the payer X requests W to generate an offline transaction τo with the desired amount destined to the account y (step 3). 

&gt; In the third phase, the payee Y redeems the bitcoins he received offline by broadcasting τo into the Bitcoin network (step 4) and optionally obtaining network confirmation n -To (step 5). 

&gt; The network confirmation will only be issued, if the network has not detected a double-spending attack against τo. Otherwise, the payee Y will trigger an optional double-spender revocation procedure, which includes sending a double-spender revocation transaction τr (step 6) to the Bitcoin network and obtaining corresponding confirmation n -Tr (step 7).

How does the transfer between the payer and payee's wallet actually happen if both nodes are offline? Does the offline wallet operate as a Layer 2 protocol somewhat allowing for deferred settlement like LN?"

Since a few days I can neither withdraw money nor coins. So my account is blocked.

Not only my account. There a a lot of Japanese customers of Bitflyer who cannot get their money. 
The complaints hotline is totally overwhelmed, it takes hours waiting for your turn. And then the person on the phone would not give any answers. He will talk to the person in charge, but will not tell if or till when you can expect an answer. 

Now Bitflyer is a place you can send money and coins to, but cannot get them out anmore. 

Last week we got some information from Bitflyer Japan that they got an ""improvement order"" from the the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA).

It looks that they now review the information related to KYC.

The result is that withdrawal of money or coins is blocked until further notice. But they don't say when that will be.

My information, like Japanese address, bank account, contact email and phone number etc. has been approved and was ok till now. Nothing changed, but suddenly me and many others are blocked. What's going on.

Bitcoin currently consumes 0.32% of the world's electricity supply. Those costs will find their way back to the users, one way or another, most likely either through high inflation or through high transaction fees.

The network functions due to a massive proof of work system that leads to enormous industrial facilities in China and other places with cheap electricity. However, this reward drops by 50% every four years. 

As the electricity wasted declines, it becomes easier to double-spend on the network. Some forks are good examples of the risk the system faces when the electricity spent on a proof of work network is very low. In the words of Mark Karpeles: ""For proof-of-work to be an effective method of blockchain protection, it needs to be an ecological disaster.""

People on this subreddit won't tell you about this, because they're ""hodlers"", who plan to sell their coins to the next fool, for an even higher price. A lot of you reading here are probably people who bought in at the top of the bubble and now patiently waiting to break even on your investment. There's no guarantee that will ever happen.

When you buy stuff with Bitcoin the merchant isn't really getting Bitcoins, he's getting dollars. An intermediate such as BitPay sells your Bitcoins and pays the merchant.

Thus, spending your bitcoins isn't different than selling, it drives the price down.

The only accepted way of using Bitcoins is to trade directly for them without going through fiat first. Find merchants, people on craiglist that accept Bitcoin.

8u9c1o,1530103765,Turil,0,3,The Great Bitcoin Story (a philosophical/mythological origin story of Bitcoin),"A little time ago, somewhere on the Earth (probably) a human decided to make a new game for other humans to play, where there are points you can collect.  This human, who likes to hide from the public, and be called by the mystery name ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", called the game Bitcoin, because it was made to be played especially on computers, which use ""bits"" that are like ones and zeros to store information. And because the main point of the game is to collect ""coins"".

Bitcoin is like the game with the money that you might know from countries and other large areas — like Euros, dollars, yen, pounds, and so on — only in this case, instead of a government or a big bank (that the government approves of) deciding what the rules of the game are, this individual human was the one to do it.  This human decided to keep the game mostly on computers, where those who played kept track of the scores for everyone, using computer software to do lots and lots of math, including adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.  The computer files that keep track of the scores are called a ""ledger"", named after the old paper notebooks that humans used to keep track of scores before they had computers.  Eventually, a lot of other humans decided to play the game, and now the game is somewhat popular all around the planet.  Anyone who has a computer and can figure out what the rules are, can play, though some kinds of play are very complicated and require very fancy computers.  Some humans even get together to make whole buildings full of fancy computers to get as many points as they can.

The original way to get points was to help everyone playing keep track of the points that everyone playing has, using computers.  But now you can also get points by finding someone who already has some points and giving them other kinds of things, including points from other games like (the local currency), or stuff or favors, in trade, or even sometimes they will give you to them for free, like a gift.  And sometimes other players will steal your points, which is mean, but is definitely a part of the game where humans really want points (usually used to trade for things they need, or really want).

One of the important parts of the game is having a secret code of numbers, letters, or words, which they call the ""key"".  If someone else gets your key, they can take your points.  So players are very careful to hide those keys in different ways.  It's much harder to steal points from someone if you don't have their keys, though it is possible.

There is really no goal in the game other than to collect points.  So it's not that interesting a game compared to more creative games, but you can sometimes use your points to trade for fun and useful stuff, and because humans change the value of the points, compared to other points and things, you can sometimes get a lot of cool stuff for very few points.  So that's where many folks find the fun in the game.  Players who get really into the game can also have fun working on the rules and finding interesting ways to change them a little bit, or a lot.  But they can't just change the rules the way they want, as most everyone else has to agree to play by any new rules.  So they don't change too often.  Also, some players like to make things that work with the rules, so that you can play the game on different kinds of computers/devices, and in slightly different ways.

Finally, the folks who like this game a whole lot sometimes like to compete against other games, and say that their game is better, especially since anyone who wants to play, or help make the rules, is allowed to do so, as long as they can figure out how, and can get a good enough computer.  Most other money games don't let just anyone make the rules or keep track of the score, and many Bitcoin fans think that's no fair.  They think their point collecting game is more fair, and thus those who play the Bitcoin game are winners no matter how many points they have in the game."

8u9ll9,1530106038,Cryptochist,3,2,There’s nothing “Happy” about HAPPY TAX,"On March 26th 2017 I hired HAPPY TAX to handle my crypto reconciliation and e-file my state and federal taxes.  500$ with a 100$ discount that didn’t work originally, but was rectified quickly. 

No mention of a back log or filing extensions before I purchased. After I purchased I was actually reassured that there’s still plenty of time before the 17th to get it done on time. 

First contact was Lynne for the reconciliation. Starts pushing me to file extension “we offer it for free” 

I paid to have my taxes done on time.

She was against using Btc.tax.com info. Even though I already paid them 30$ to do it and it’s advertised on there site they accept it. She claimed api info isn’t accurate. She wanted to manually enter each csv file into their way of doing it. I did business on only Coinbase and gdax. I had no other income or dependents. This was the easiest scenario possible and she made me jump though unnecessarily hoops that procured identical data that I already had. 

No personal attention to the customer. I kept getting emails about extensions. I kept asking for definitive answers about my taxes being filed on time. No dice. Just generalized or mass email answers. 

No professionalism. When I finally was called by my “CPA” the numbers didn’t jive at all. They persisted in my using their minimization method. I have a business degree, two years of corporate, business and personal IRS tax along with 2 years of accounting that I excelled in and graduated suma cum laude GPA 4.0

I say this not to brag or boast- who gives a shit? I know that FIFO IS THE RECOMMENDED METHOD. 

I asked can I change to FIFO next year: SURE. NO!
You have to file a written reason a year in advance for such a change. 
If I had taken their “advice” I’d of been audited. The minimization method accounts for gains in later years -not good if you plan on making a lot of money in upcoming years. Completely ridiculous unprofessional advice. 

The answers I’m giving here are directly from a reputable local CPA by the name of Hunter Nottingham. He accepts business from anywhere in the US. He’s also working on several crypto apps for tax and filing purposes that are more accurate and user friendly for next year than what’s currently in the market. He’s an avid crypto investor, accepts crypto as payment for his personalized services and is very adept at crypto reconciliation done the right way.

HAPPY TAX strung me along from March 26th to April 15th and two days before the deadline tried to charge me an additional $250 because of multiple exchanges. COINBASE owns GDAX. They are one of the same. Coinbase is a buying/selling platform and GDAX is an actual exchange owned by the former. I was outraged at this point. After sending an email mentioning my concerns and disappointment, the CEO admitted to having some hiring issues and problems. But then went on to up-charge me $250 for filing a complaint.  I lost it. I called and spoke to Christa my “CPA” livid. I asked for her CPA license number and she says she doesn’t have one because she’s not a CPA. But she claimed to be one earlier. FRAUD

They decided to refund my money two days before the tax deadline. AND BASICALLY LEAVE ME SCREWED ON TAX DAY. 

I got my money back a day after the tax deadline.

Hunter Nottingham did my brothers taxes. So I called him. 24 hours. Done. Accurate. Personalized attention. Professionalism. The Cost? $400. Effortless.

I started a YouTube Channel, and here is the short pitch:

&gt;Ever get frustrated when someone explains something either too simply such that you feel like you’re missing a lot of the main details or with too many complicated words such that it goes way over your head?   
&gt;  
&gt;RRR Academy bridges that gap for a wide range of concepts related to technology. Every lesson for every concept is explained in three levels of difficulty: Rudimentary, Realistic and Remarkable. 

[Here ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3Hzu5YM-5I)is a link to the first video, which is the Rudimentary Difficulty of the first lesson on Bits.

I love teaching and given the lack of understanding of Bitcoin outside of this community, I figured I could fill a need with this channel. 

Please let me know what you think. Each video takes a lot of time so I want to know whether or these type videos are effective and helpful before I decide on how to move forward."
8udcab,1530133371,aelaos1,0,57,For how long will we pretend the problem doesn't exist,"I am here for a long time (look past reddit date) with the community. There is a very clear problem that arises very often and we all know that is the fees. They make Bitcoin as a payment system quite unusable. We had a divided community split in Nov and then the narrative of ""store of value"" started.  

Let's stop being pretentious here. How many merchants after stripe, microsoft, expedia and many others will stop accepting Bitcoin? This is the OPPOSITE of adoption.  

I was there sending emails in 2011 to merchants to get accepted because we had this great payment system that would revolutionize everything. WHERE IS IT?  

I had many discussions here with people that are involved deeply and I am hearing some irrational arguments that high fees now are \*good\* but they will be fixed. Like you need to fix something if it is good.  

Well, when it is actually fixed it will be TOO LATE.  

This should be a wakeup call. The problem can (and could) be temporarily solved by increasing the block size for now along with rolling LN. Or just find another solution.  No innovation EVER had reversal of adoption and then went on to become dominant!

P.S I don't care if I get banned at all. All I care is the thing I am fighting to convince everyone online and IRL is better than existing systems. "

I've read it quickly, and I must say, that VanEck has a nice trick with OTC trading. If you remember, in 2017 most of the ETF were rejected because SEC said it's too hard to determine singular BTC price since there are so many different prices across exchanges. If they use OTC trading, the price is negotiated each time with OTC dealer, making previous argument from SEC irrelevant. Furthermore, they are going to provide their own custody for Bitcoins and insurance. I don't want to get overhyped about this, but this sounds really really good."

There are huge groups of shills all over the forum spreading misleading information just to knock the price down.  They specialize in creating FUD out of even the most obviously positive news.  

The only thing saving bulls is that in an absolute sense Bitcoin has a limited supply of coins.  So while bears might be able to market dump thousands of coins to manipulate the value of their leveraged positions, they will not be able to stop the price from going up when enough accumulation has taken place.

While it is true that people can go 100 times long on their positions, they do not have an army of people intentionally posting positive news across the entire internet.

The best way to beat bears is to keep quietly buying.  They are determined to kill the entire market."

8ueumf,1530146030,Pizdie,0,9,Bitfi Hardware Wallet,"I posted a link to a website on the Bitcoin and Monero subreddit last week on a new type of cryptocurrency hardware storage. My post was criticized heavily by its readers, most providing little to no information to back their opinions. Rather than to argue blatantly I decided to construct my own due diligence to hopefully create an open conversation about crypto wallet security on this subreddit. Therefore I will provide an in-depth analysis of the Bitfi hardware wallet based on all information publicly available. As a disclaimer, I am not an affiliate with Bitfi, and all related references used in this post will be added below.

Despite all the negative headlines Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have received over past decade these digital assets have increased in tremendous popularity and price. Its usability revolutionized the way value is stored, transferred, and exchanged. The intrinsic benefit of this new technology led to an explosive innovative growth in both computing hardware, and many other blockchain-based assets that operate within a highly secure digital infrastructure. The functionality and authenticity of these blockchain assets come at no debate, however with the growing number of users an issue still remains of where to properly store coins/tokens from either being lost or stolen. In the article, 'The Most Comprehensive Cryptocurrency Wallet Guide', written by Simona Vaitkune on Medium gives a detailed breakdown on the five types of digital asset storage options including online, mobile, desktop, hardware, and paper wallets.

The general concept of digital wallets is to allow users to virtually store their cryptocurrencies, which are secured by a public and private key. These wallets heavily differentiate from each other based on levels of security protection which depends upon several key aspects including hot/cold wallets, anonymity, and multi-feature security layers including two-factor authentication (2FA), multi-sig, backup files (12- 24 word recovery seed), and software updates.

Hot wallets are meant for instant use and are only accessible if linked by an Internet connection to use on exchanges, desktop, or mobile applications. Digital assets stored on hot wallets exemplify the greatest potential risk for unrecoverable funds. The security of hot wallets is mainly dependent upon the security habits of the individual holder and third parties themselves. They are considered most vulnerable based on prior evidence from exchange server hacks, phishing scams, and computer vulnerability as well if broken, stolen, or infected with malware.

Cold wallets refer to a type of storage that is not connected to the Internet and can be secured using different facets such as a hardware device, paper, and even brain wallets. Its access resides offline until manually retrieving the private key using a pin, mnemonic phrase, or both. Long-term funds are likely to be held in cold wallet storage and by far the safest option in regards to security.

Bitfi is a global payments technology company based in the US that enables businesses and consumers to securely participate in a decentralized economy. Their mission is to accelerate the growth and adoption of digital assets. This past week the company released their Knox hardware wallet focusing mainly on user-friendliness and air-gapped security. When visiting the homepage of the Bitfi website they state its “the worlds first un-hackable device”, and seeing this as someone who has been in the computer space for over 15 years it can bring a sense of unease. Ignoring the fact that they supposedly have John Mcafe now on their team, let us dig in further to what makes this device so remarkable.

The transition of storing cryptocurrencies on any type of cold wallet can seem highly technical for someone who is inexperienced with encryption technology. If sets of rules are not followed funds can be lost forever. Bitfi intends on making this easier and safer for the average individual. Instead of having to write down a 24-word mnemonic phrase or separate private keys for each coin, and then worrying on how to safely store it from theft or damage. Bitfi created an algorithm, which acts similar to a brain wallet giving a user the freedom to make a long unique phrase they can easily remember (for example: “Ilovemyjobbecausetheypayme@5”) will be specific for them and impossible to guess or brute force.

Unlike popular cryptocurrency hardware devices such as Trezor or Ledger Nano S, the Bitfi Knox wallets DO NOT store the user's private keys in the hardware. If the Bitfi Knox device is stolen or seized and then taken apart the keys are unable to be retrieved. Since there are no private keys are stored on the device there is also no potential for a “man in the middle” or distribution attack that can occur where a user's keys are stolen prior to actually receiving the device. We saw this happen when unfortunate consumers purchased the Ledger Nano S from 3rd party sellers this past year.

As explained by CEO Daniel Khesin, the Bitfi Knox wallet is not a storage device but rather a separate CPU running calculations for their open sourced algorithm. A secret phrase the user created will calculate the private key to sign for transactions made on the Bitfi dashboard. The device will also update automatically to the latest firmware when connected to Wi-Fi, and routes to company node that allows a user to view all their balances on the device. Bitfi will also release an app on the phone that will work with the Knox wallet to allow their users to purchase products and services on the go.

The device itself has a smartphone type of look to it with an LED Touchscreen, multi-currency support, dashboard and other additional customizable features. Bitfi plans on continually integrating blockchain assets every few weeks. They currently support Bitcoin, Ethereum (ERC20 tokens), EOS, NEO/GAS, Litecoin, and lastly Monero being the first company to functionally implement the popular privacy coin on their wallet without additional downloads from Github.

On their webpage, it looks as if the wallet already went on sale, and within a short period of time sold out entirely. In my opinion, I have never heard of a hardware wallet that performs like this so I am interested in purchasing one just to see if Bitfi Knox succeeds in its functional promise.

In his view, BTC could drop below $6,000 (February low) and could test immediate support of $5,755 and $5,711. A daily close below $5,755 (Sunday's Doji candle low) would open the doors to $5,090 (rising wedge breakdown target). On the higher side, only a daily close (as per UTC) above $6,425 (April 1 low) would abort the bearish view and allow a corrective rally. BTC will likely outperform other cryptocurrencies as indicated by the bearish breakdown on ETH/BTC chart.

I just wanted to give my thoughts on something that we need to be stressing more heavily in our community.

A majority of everyday people who don't consider themselves very tech-savvy believe in the misconception that Bitcoin is inherently an anonymous digital currency. (Warren Buffet: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/19/heres-what-warren-buffett-really-thinks-about-bitc.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/19/heres-what-warren-buffett-really-thinks-about-bitc.aspx))

Most tech people who consider themselves fairly familiar with technology (but not so much with cryptocurrencies) believe that Bitcoin is anonymous. (Bill Gates: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2018/02/27/bill-gates-i-dont-think-bitcoins-anonymity-is-a-good-thing/#46f038a71395](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2018/02/27/bill-gates-i-dont-think-bitcoins-anonymity-is-a-good-thing/#46f038a71395))

These two alone spread enough misinformation about this that it convinces a majority of the population that Bitcoin is anonymous. Even r/bitcioin has posts saying Bitcoin is anonymous with 50+ Upvotes ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ym3be/you\_can\_buy\_bitcoin\_almost\_everywhere\_anonymously/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ym3be/you_can_buy_bitcoin_almost_everywhere_anonymously/))

It's clear to me that there is too much misinformation out there about how blockchain works and what separates Moreno from the standard public blockchain. Looking back I'm not sure where I was going with this post, so I guess let this be a reminder to remind people that Bitcoin is not anonymous, and there is a valid use-case for something MUCH better which is built to be anonymous.

For example if people complain that the devs are taking too long to implement lightning, cant they just code a lightning implementation themselves and propose it to the network to get accepted? I don't see how developers have control over the coin and get to choose when bitcoin hard and soft forks then unless its just a thing for miners that if its being proposed you better fork or get left behind if everyone else goes with it. Maybe I'm not explaining my question right but if its decentralized I dont see how there technically is a core development team. I'm only thinking about this because I saw a letter from the coinbase C.E.O. criticizing the core development team for taking too long to implement something a few years back and I thought to myself if he is so frustrated with the core team's ""inaction"" why doesn't he just hire a development team itself to put forth the code and let the community decide if they want to soft fork to it.

Having previously used Trezor, I was quite interested in this new offering. For those who don’t know, FuzeW and Trezor are hardware devices to store your cryptocurrency in a hack-proof environment. 

The product comes in a small black box with a shiny FuzeW engraving on top. On lifting the lid, I was greeted by the FuzeW enclosed in a soft black covering. 

[Original box](https://imgur.com/qkAhwO5) (after opening)

Underneath the card, I found a black envelope which carried the recovery sheets, followed by a white slide-in charging cradle. One of the employees informed me that the eCharger text on the cradle will replaced by Fuze. Sounds like a good decision to me.

[Charger underneath everything](https://imgur.com/hjrDjIZ)

So the first thing I noticed was how beautifully the card has been designed, and how similar it looked to my credit card, and how very different from other hardware wallets.

[Another view of the card](https://imgur.com/MBDL4qu)
 
It felt slight heavier than my credit card and quite sturdy in my hand. What I liked most about the design was the premium, rubbery feel, and how easily it can slide into my Ridge Wallet (which is a credit card holder type wallet) 

The 3.1 inch e-paper display has 3 buttons on the bottom right hand corner that allow you to select designated currency, split transactions between payment methods, and lock the card for security purposes. The card can be managed via an android/iOS application and additional cards can be added to the account just by taking a picture of them. In case your FuzeW is left behind, the mobile app will alert your smartphone and you could erase all the information on your card just with a click of a button. FuzeW has adopted multiple security layers such as SEIC and EAL-5 certified SE, two factor authentication, and OTP verification.

Another thing I’d like to point out is the IP68 rating against water and dust, which is the same as the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy. "

8uh5ye,1530171260,13h9dv,1,0,State of Bitcoin ATMs in Japan?,"Longtime lurker, first time poster.

I've been trying to find info on the state of Bitcoin ATMs in Japan, mainly Tokyo. The Pink Cow in Roppongo used to have one, as did Numazuko Sushi in Ginza. Both have been removed. Looking up ATMs online, I find a lot of dead links and old information, but so far the pattern shows that a lot of former Bitcoin ATM hosts have removed them.

I heard some stories that new regulations in 2017 meant that it was too difficult to operate an ATM legally, but I haven't found more than rumor or speculation on that front.

Does anybody know what happened to all of Tokyo/Japan's Bitcoin ATMs? And are there any working ones left in Japan at all?

Thanks in advance."

&gt;An economic bubble or asset bubble (sometimes also referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. It could also be described as a situation in which asset prices appear to be based on implausible or inconsistent views about the future. 

BTC is a bubble because its value almost entirely speculative. Its real world advantages to fiat are minuscule while having significant downsides. There are details of every economic bubble resulting from over-speculation since 1950 below.

**The Poseidon bubble**

&gt;The Poseidon bubble was a stock market bubble in which the price of Australian mining shares soared in late 1969, then crashed in early 1970.   
&gt;  
&gt;In the late 1960s, nickel was in high demand due to the Vietnam War, but there was a shortage of supply due to industrial action against the major Canadian supplier Inco. These factors pushed the price of nickel to record levels, peaking at around £7,000/ton on the London market early in November 1969. In September 1969, the mining company Poseidon NL made a major nickel discovery at Windarra in the Shire of Laverton, Western Australia. In early September their shares had been trading at $0.80, but as information about the discovery was released, the price rose until it was trading at $12.30 on October 1. After this, very little further information came to light, but the price continued to climb due to speculation; at one point, a UK broker **suggested a value of up to $382 a share.**  By the time Poseidon actually started producing nickel, the price of nickel had fallen. Also, the nickel ore was of a lower grade than originally thought, so extraction costs were higher. Profits from the mine were not sufficient to keep Poseidon afloat, and in 1976 it delisted. [Western Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMC_Resources) then took over the mine, operating it until 1991.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon\_bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon_bubble)

**POS now trades at $0.037 AUD per share.** Over-speculation in something that turned out to be near worthless led to its share going to 0. BTC could share the same fate if it does not prove superior to fiat. Note that POS still has value as a mining company.

**The dot-com bubble**

&gt;The dot-com bubble was a historic economic bubble and period of excessive speculation that occurred roughly from 1997 to 2001, a period of extreme growth in the usage and adaptation of the Internet.   
&gt;  
&gt;Most dot-com companies incurred net operating losses as they spent heavily on advertising and promotions to harness network effects to build market share or mind share as fast as possible, using the mottos ""get big fast"" and ""get large or get lost"". These companies offered their services or products for free or at a discount with the expectation that they could build enough brand awareness to charge profitable rates for their services in the future. In January 2000, there were 16 dot-com commercials during Super Bowl XXXIV, each costing $2 million for a 30-second spot.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ""growth over profits"" mentality and the aura of ""new economy"" invincibility led some companies to engage in lavish spending on elaborate business facilities and luxury vacations for employees. Upon the launch of a new product or website, a company would organize an expensive event called a dot com party.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com\_bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)

*Processing img a35qj9bk3p611...*

Summarising, people were sucked into buying shares from companies that were not actually profiting (growing in real value) believing they could get rich quick. Once prices got too high, people sold and the bubble popped. **It took 16 years for the index to return to the previous high**. The value of the index currently sits at 7445.08. Note that internet-based companies have much greater real-world value than BTC currently.

 **Japanese asset price bubble**

&gt;The Japanese asset price bubble was an economic bubble in Japan from 1986 to 1991 in which real estate and stock market prices were greatly inflated. In early 1992, this price bubble collapsed. The bubble was characterized by rapid acceleration of asset prices and overheated economic activity, as well as an uncontrolled money supply and credit expansion. More specifically, over-confidence and speculation regarding asset and stock prices had been closely associated with excessive monetary easing policy at the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;By August 1990, the Nikkei stock index had plummeted to half its peak by the time of the fifth monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). By late 1991, asset prices began to fall. Even though asset prices had visibly collapsed by early 1992, the economy's decline continued for more than a decade. This decline resulted in a huge accumulation of non-performing assets loans (NPL), causing difficulties for many financial institutions.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese\_asset\_price\_bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble)

With the aid of government policies, ‘the Nikkei has periodically risen above 1991 values since, as of 2017 it remains below 1991 values.’"

First off, the tokenomics of Bitcoin works so that there is only a finite of bitcoin in existence. The mining system of Bitcoin is a way to attach physical real world value to the digital currency this of course helps to legitimize it to a point. Also, as Bitcoin gains traction from institutions and Wall Street, it could be legitimized as a digitized store of value. With this thinking, Bitcoin really comes off looking like digital gold. With its PoW system placing physical value on Bitcoin + its huge future popularity, can anyone truly say for sure that Bitcoin is a bubble waiting to happen? this is the first time we have encountered such a system, so no one can really be sure. I believe the reasons stated above could possibly make it bubble proof. 

*Yes of course there can and will be small bubbles, but will there really be a bubble that will make bitcoin valueless? 

What are your thoughts/opinions on the matter?

A lot of people are busy with their lives and few even heard of it back then.  But in 2021 (2.5 years) I will blame people who were made aware of it and chose to ignore it this time around. 

Maybe 25x returns will not be possible with each additional having. Eventually bitcoin returns would be equivalent to a bond yield maybe by 2028.  

From here maybe 12x by next post halving bear 'bottom' in 2022.  Still a remarkable return for those with enough skin in the game.  

Right now while risk is high we can expect appreciation but as that risk comes down the asset becomes best for storage of value and transfer of value.

Anyway, some food for thought.

I don't want anybody to buy this stock....just to watch what happens to it, and if it explodes in value within the next 2 trading days, I want you to know that I picked this solely by using technical analysis, and that you might want to reconsider using technical analysis when choosing your entry an exit points for trading bitcoin.

I have done the dry-run to check that I have my seed words.  I have read that this update will wipe my Trezor, and although I supposedly have my seed words, wiping my device is giving me anxiety just thinking about it.  So, a few questions below for the group before I do anything:

1.  Do I have to update?  I only used my Trezor One as cold storage for BTC and don't need the new bells and whistles.  Am I at risk of losing my BTC if I don't update my Trezor for an extended period of time?

2.  If I wait for version 1.6.3, is there a chance Trezor fixes this issue and uploading from 1.6.1 to 1.6.3 will not require wiping my device?

3.  If I send my BTC from Trezor to Coinbase as an extra precaution before the wipe, will this create a taxable event when I send my BTC stash back to Trezor?  Will the IRS now know how many BTC I have?

4.  I have my seed words and a passcode at the end.  Does this affect anything with the Trezor reboot besides turning on the advanced password mode and typing it in at restart?

5.  Is there any possibility greater than 0&amp;#37; that the correct seed words will not bring back my original wallet holding the bitcoins?

I am trying to take precautions with my BTC by not keep them on an exchange, etc., but this is kind of annoying and scary.  Thanks for the help."

8ukvvp,1530202519,ayanamirs,3,6,The state is:," The State, in the words of Oppenheimer, is the “organization of the political means”; it is the systematization of the predatory process over a given territory. For crime, at best, is sporadic and uncertain; the parasitism is ephemeral, and the coercive, parasitic lifeline may be cut off at any time by the resistance of the victims. The State provides a legal, orderly, systematic channel for the predation of private property; it renders certain, secure, and relatively “peaceful” the lifeline of the parasitic caste in society. Since production must always precede predation, the free market is anterior to the State. The State has never been created by a “social contract”; it has always been born in conquest and exploitation. The classic paradigm was a conquering tribe pausing in its time-honored method of looting and murdering a conquered tribe, to realize that the timespan of plunder would be longer and more secure, and the situation more pleasant, if the conquered tribe were allowed to live and produce, with the conquerors settling among them as rulers exacting a steady annual tribute."

He is making predictions such as BTC bottoming out this year (2018) in October/November between 3K-5K, which is pretty specific. 

Can someone in this subreddit please advise if this guy actually knows what he is talking about. I always get this fishy feeling when watching his content.

I personally just correlate Google Trends to BTC price to get the best understanding of what's going on.

Because it's unstoppable, banks will adapt to crypto and they'll just integrate bitcoin in the business. 
You're gonna have bitcoin loans and bitcoin saving accounts. Bitcoin credit cards,  all that shit. All linked to probably an official state coin. Probably a small number of decentralized altcoins too. No shitcoins :). 
If a coin won't make it on the list they deal probably will lose a lot of exposure and value.

They will invest in farms and will manipulate the market in every way they will be able to. Just like today with... basically everything.

 The Conservative Party of Quebec is a small, new political party in Quebec currently polling at around 3-5&amp;#37;, with close to 10&amp;#37; in some regions. Back in 2013, a lot of Bitcoiners supported this party, which is \*the first and only\* Quebec political party to accept Bitcoin for membership, since 2014 if I remember (proof: [https://i.imgur.com/b0anaXl.png](https://i.imgur.com/b0anaXl.png)). Many of the Bylls team, as well as our customers and friends, are supportive of this political party as the best for Bitcoin. Even if the Conservative Party is too small in Quebec to affect the Bitcoin mining outcome, Bitcoiners can count on some politicians to have their backs.  


 \*\*Quote\*\*   


""Cryptocronyism at the Liberal Party of Québec? In January 2018, the president of Hydro-Québec announced publicly that he was hoping to be able to sell millions of dollars worth of electricity to the energy-hungry cryptomining industry, a fledling business that had begun sprouting in Quebec without government permission or hand-outs. Then suddenly, just two weeks later, HQ started toback-pedalling, arguing that it would not be able to respond completly to the long-term demand in the sector. It later said that it had received projects for 18,000 megawatts (MW), representing 40 &amp;#37; of its production. Such a request was far beyond what it could provide and, if it were accepted, we were told, it could compromise the electricity supply of Quebec consumers (we wouldn't want Mrs Tremblay to be run out of electricity while cooking her dinner turkey!). But any expert in cryptomining worth his salt could have told you that this figure was only a speculative demand boosted on steroids since the world's current consumption of cryptominers is about 4 400 MW! 

Hydro-Québec has actually confessed during public hearings held this week that it never investigated the seriousness of the projects submitted. Hydro-Québec had all the powers it needs to refuse most of these frivolous requests. But our politicians wouldn't want a good crisis to go to waste... they immediately saw an opportunity to seize... a few weeks before the general election. Philippe Couillard's government has used the usual fearmonging tactic (pretext: an atypical demand) to politicize once again the Quebec energy market by imposing a moratorium then a tortuous auction system to sell electricity to what it arbitrarily considered the ""best"" cryptominers... 

By happenchance, at the same time, Bitmain, a huge Chinese monopoly with a dubious reputation, started an intense lobbying effort in Quebec. Why would I not be surprised if, in the middle of the electoral campaign, Minister Pierre Moreau announced ""a major structuring investment"" by Bitmain, accompanied by staggering promises of job creation in various areas of Quebec (notably those where liberal candidates with sagging polls need a boost for their campaign), all in exchange for a long-term contract with our public utility? We've seen this movie before with wind power and biomass contracts! If this is the case, this shameful diversion of Hydro-Québec for electoral purposes will not only harm Quebec cryptomining companies but will also confirm the reputation that Quebec is not open to business unless you rely on crony capitalism The Conservative Party of Quebec would stop politicizing Quebec's energy and let the free market decide winners and losers of any new technology, to the benefit of Quebec consumers.""

I will take you back all the way to 2013 first. 

https://i.redd.it/rm6l4drp7u611.jpg

Here we hit the peak of the highest point so far BTC ever was on 11-28. Far above the 365 day moving average (and all others for that matter.

By April of 2014 BTC was more than half of its peaked value just 5 months earlier. 

https://i.redd.it/ue1ipr758u611.jpg

2014 was a very slow year. In fact, the whole year BTC never recovered to its peak and by the end of 2015 BTC had fallen 70&amp;#37; from its peak. for half of the year BTC was below the 33 day MA, 55 Day MA, and 365 day MA.

https://i.redd.it/ycy7iyhk8u611.jpg

Half of 2015 BTC kept moving down, but the MAs were catching up. By July BTC had reached the 365 day MA at $272.

https://i.redd.it/ufonq7yz8u611.png

By October 2015 BTC had divergence with all the moving averages at $276.

https://i.redd.it/b1vmlzc99u611.jpg

Then for the entire year of 2016 BTC was very prosperous. It had spiked back above the previous record.

*Processing img ovig54gk9u611...*

Again, 2017 was the best year BTC has ever had. It peaked to $19,000. 

2017 was almost identical to 2014.

*Processing img drqz2wpx9u611...*

Where are we now? BTC has taken an almost IDENTICAL trend to 2014. We are just not getting below the 365 day moving average. 

*Processing img vgdk0c96au611...*

So based on this pattern -- My prediction, which means nothing, is that BTC will have down periods for the next year and a half. This is a great accumulation period. Buy BTC at any time during this down trend - By the end of 2020 BTC could easily be $190,000."

A gasoline monopoly increasing prices in order to make voters angry with an incumbent government, is a good example. Because of the risk monopolies present, nearly all participants in any given marketplace prefer orderliness and systemic bias against monopolies. Even nasty, mean-spirited, selfish rich people dislike monopolies (no, really) because their chances of becoming a beneficiary of one are exceptionally slim (statistically speaking). We don't mind the playing field being uneven - tilted in our favor - but we (as a species) are deeply biased toward fairness. This isn't ideological, it's [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).

***Could any government in the world buy or sell enough BTC to change the market price?***

This is relevant to the question of BTC price manipulation, because it means two things are pretty certain: (1) governments and wealth managers are always actively looking for ways to manipulate BTC markets and (2) we will tend to end up manipulating BTC markets cooperatively.

***How do you stop the 'Weapon-ization' of Bitcoin?***

Governments (via state banks, coordinated by NGOs like the IMF, World Bank, BIS) will secure sufficient reserves of BTC to allow them to counter any possible manipulation by any other government that holds BTC. To avoid deploying it, they will agree to targets for easing/tightening based on inflation and growth. They will allow for transparency in the decision making process and will lead to limited stabilization of the BTC price. 

If you think this sounds a lot like the broad strokes of the [Gold Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) you're right.

Government buying and selling can indeed smooth out daily BTC price fluctuations. A coordinated group of BTC reserve holders that are able to buy or sell 10&amp;#37; of the total BTC supply can offset huge 'black swan'-scale economic shocks. 

What this sort of buying and selling cannot do, however, is drive inflation. Inflation is the tool that governments use to keep people from hording currency. Spending is the 'Product' in GDP. Savings aren't counted, except as a contrarian indicator of economic health.

***So what would this look like to a BTC user?***

The value of BTC will go up over time, and you won't want to spend any. You will spend BTC on the bills you have to pay and the things you believe will appreciate in value even more quickly than BTC. The price of BTC will fluctuate by less than 1&amp;#37; on a day-to-day basis, and on average will close each day with a slightly higher value than it started with. The rate of appreciation will tend to match the incremental accumulation of global wealth plus the inflow of wealth coming from sale of other similar assets (like gold, treasuries, bonds). In the first few years of BTC's emergence (until \~2022) the rate of appreciation will seem rough with occasional surges of FOMO buying and profit-taking. On the whole, appreciation will be sharp. As volatility drops, the average incremental growth rate of BTC exchange value will fall toward the rate of global economic growth. Using gold as a guide, we can expect this to happen as the total capitalization of BTC approaches $5-10 Trillion USD (give or take a few $Trillion).

Major fiat currencies (EUR, USD, RMB) are not likely to disappear. Governments can require that their contractors, suppliers and employees accept their preferred fiat currency and can require that fees and taxes are paid with that same currency, creating arbitrary demand and supporting infrastructure. For day-to-day purchases, it may be commonplace to use fiat currencies for the foreseeable future, given the extensive existing infrastructure and well-understood regulation. For the average user, BTC may take the place of savings accounts, savings bonds, gold, annuities, treasuries, real estate, corporate bonds or even equities. For the next several years, people will use their BTC for major transactions like paying off student loans, buying cars or houses, paying off large tax bills, taking vacations, paying for medical expenses and the like. As the rate of increase in BTC value drops, it will become more and more commonplace for people to use it for increasingly smaller and more mundane purchases.

***Are governments already manipulating the price of BTC?***

Even without any specific evidence, it is quite safe to assume that they are. Any given government knows other governments can do it, therefore, they must also. Again, this is just application of [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory). It's not driven by any particular ideology or political viewpoint. Assuming governments are not all grossly incompetent (they aren't), we could also expect that they are exploring how the price of BTC can be manipulated and how they can monitor the markets for such manipulation. They are experimenting.

At this stage, where the market value of the entire BTC supply is still quite tiny, it may well be that some governments are actively doing so-called 'destructive' testing. If, at this stage of development they were to 'break' BTC the economic repercussions would be very small. For example, they may be try to depress the price to see what happens to the network when miners are starved for income. They may also drive the BTC prices up in order to observe and quantify FOMO. There could be a large number of discrete tests happening today - there's no real way to know. 

If BTC survives this period of 'destructive' experimentation (and the capitalization of BTC grows large enough that it's collapse would have meaningful economic consequences) it is likely that this testing will end and the focus of government manipulation of the BTC price will shift to stabilization.

I guess HODL is good if I expect the demand to continue increasing, but I'm not sure why that should be the case if most of the world doesn't have a use for a decentralized currency."

8upjhp,1530238858,aroundtheclock1,0,5,Speculation: Facebook/Coinbase Rumors and how awful it would be for Bitcoin,"Rumors seem to be gaining steam that Facebook could be interested in buying Coinbase. My friends and I have debated for the past 24 hours what true value the acquisition could give FB in an industry still in infancy. Regardless if you've bought bitcoin or follow cryptocurrencies, I would say that it's almost certain than the void of the internet-of-money should be rapidly closing and this is very widely believed. Middlemen like Visa, PayPal, etc. are incredibly overpaid for their services by their customers and significantly compensated for the data they sell back to advertisers. 

My initial reaction was that it'd obviously bring FB into the space like thunder and they could realize value almost immediately by reducing FOREX/Tax exposure on their app/marketplace sales. You would also be opening a platform to nearly 2 billion people and claiming relatively high transaction fees for the retail investors it would likely attract (speculators paying $1.49 for buying a small $25 ""investment"" in bitcoin). That would deliver some nice revenue for FB, but I don't think it's there play with the acquisition. 

For the purposes of this argument we can assume that should FB enter the cryptocurrency space, it would undoubtably wield a lot of power and resources to both convince advertisers and merchants on the future potential of the technology. 

It's important to point out that nearly all Coinbase accounts are not true bitcoin wallets. Coinbase is a custodian, just like a bank, and you don't own access to the private keys (in almost every case). It's also likely that retail adopters do not posses the level of aptitude to ever full understand the benefits that Bitcoin's cryptography provides (hence the popularity of Coinbase) and are likely fine with not controlling their private key. 

**If Facebook were to buy Coinbase, they'd have granular level data into all historical purchases their users have ever made.**

Certainly, they already have a lot of this high level data through use of tokens, cookies, apis, etc. But they don't have this level of granularity. 

How could they become successful at this? Simple, by eating Tx fees. This provides obvious benefit to the merchant because they're no longer shilling out 2-5&amp;#37; on Visa, Square, etc. FB would recoup their fee exposure by selling profiles built from your consumption trends. 

This of course would be bittersweet. People who maintain their own wallets and private keys would still maintain some level of anonymity, but such a move would be tremendously detrimental to the value in which Bitcoin was founded. I realize this was long winded, but hoped to stimulate some dialog. 

TL; DR: Facebook buying Coinbase would allow them to build profiles on everything their users have ever purchased. "

After seeing the transaction pool swell up so greatly in December (if I recall,$30-$40 per transaction (crazy!!!)) It seemed pretty obvious that Bitcoin wasn't anywhere NEAR ready for the mass adoption that we all dream of it eventually having. I know solutions such as LN have emerged, and while I haven't given a lot of time researching these alternate solutions, I do wonder how and why a bigger block size hasn't occured in the main BTC chain.

A large argument against block size increase I've read is this creates an increase in centralization. My question is how and why? A mining farm with 30% hash power has just as much control in a block size of 1mb as it would in a 16mb, 0.5mb, or any other size block, right? Maybe I'm not understanding something there.

Anyways, I'm curious to hear some knowledge on this. "

Some asking for 30% more.,"Scene: Reserve bank of India doesn't understand Bitcoin &amp; other cryptocurrency and also admit they don't have a clue what they should do about it. They ban every bank from providing services to every crypto exchange based in India. They ask every bank to block the bank accounts of holders who will use their money to buy Bitcoin (Prevent citizens from using their own money when it isn't even illegal to own crypto).

Outcome: Onramps and offramps have been cut off by the government so people can't use white money. Bitcoin holders are now offering to sell Bitcoin in Black money in Cash at a premium of around 30%. People are actually buying at such a high price because if citizens can't use their own money the way they want, what's the value of such money. Some(very few) are offering services in exchange of crypto so they don't have to disclose or pay taxes.

8urane,1530257693,somerandomdudeman1,5,0,The Relationship between HODLing and Mainstream Usage of Bitcoin,"I have been lurking reddit and in the bitcoin community for 3 years and with its ups and downs, I have been on a really wild ride.

First and foremost, I want to point out that although I believe in the intrinsic value and positive aspects bitcoin brings to the world, there are also negative aspects. Even if no system is entirely perfect, I do believe that bitcoin has more than a fair chance to be adopted much more widely and put to good use, hence increasing it's value.

Ever since beginning 2017 or so (or sooner, or later, don't know exactly), many people have almost chosen sides on whether HODLing is a good phenomenon or a negative one for the bitcoin community and it's development. People argue that hodling is bad because it doesn't help adoption of bitcoin. On the other hand some others claim that hodling increases it's value.

I want to give you my perspective because I have a business that has been accepting bitcoin and ETH since late 2015. I have no coding skills, nor am I a graduate of enigneering... in fact I never even went to university.

Some of you can call me a hodler because I do not sell my bitcoin, I only keep stacking in up. I havent sold any during the 20k peak of late last year. Whatever bitcoin I amass I keep, and people who want to take advantage of my discounts when using crypto will buy bitcoins in order to pay me. In the end, many other people in my line of work also started accepting cryptos and the community surrounding our domain is now almost entirely run on cryptocurrency as default payment method (most notably bitcoin).

That means our customers are constantly paying us with bitcoins, which means they are constantly buying it from someone else.

Now I can obviously just loop the bitcoins back to them at a fee, since they want to remain discreet as buyers and believe it offers more anonymity than paying with paypal or a credit card (whether or not this is true is an entire other subject of discussion and I am not discussing that in this post). But if I would do that, I would just close this community off from any external communities that wish to make bitcoin more mainstream and actually used as a payment method.

So I just wanted to give my 2 cents out there and say that I am both contributing to bitcoin's adoption as a currency but also a long-term hodler. I am both. Even if I have nothing to contribute in terms of code or technology that can propel bitcoin further because I have no technical skills whatsoever, I do believe I help in terms of the adoption as a currency.

I have never posted here, but it did feel good to say this!"

So even though buyers are speculating that they will be able to sell at a higher price at a future date, they are also providing liquidity to a seller which is providing a service to that seller by making bitcoin an effective store of value.  

If you have an interest in the success of Bitcoin as a stable currency you help every time you help a seller cash out.  With enough users that risk should become a self-fulfilling prophesy as to the value of Bitcoin.  Supply,Demand, Number of Users, Buyers and Sellers are the variables.  More demand, fixed supply, more users, and steady buys and sells mathmatically assure a very high price.

It should also be considered that passive money is increasing everyday because of human nature.  Brute force deflation might be enough by itself to push the price up without having to depend on constant growth.  I think there is a lot of reason to be optimistic that Bitcoin is a good longterm investment even now.  "

8uro8o,1530262788,1ncehost,70,173,Let's clear this up with empirical evidence: Bitcoin doesn't need to be spent to have value.,"*Why Bitcoin does not need to be spent*

The world has approximately $700-800T in non-derivative assets. This includes real estate, equities, bonds, commodities, cash, and all the bits of stuff people use in their daily lives. The majority of those assets are not used to trade with.

Take a look at this classic (yet flawed) infographic: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-how-much-money-exists-in-the-entire-world-in-one-chart-2015-12-18


Cash, as in the type you can hold in your hand, make up about $8T

Cash, as in the type you keep in a bank account, makes up about $90T


That means 6 out of 7 of the world's assets are not used as a unit of account. If you consider your own assets, you will probably find a similar ratio of cash-to-other-stuff (investments, real estate, cars). 6 out of 7 units of value in the world have their value from something other than their ability to be a unit of account.


In order to have a large inherent value, bitcoin need only have a niche of a niche of the utility of any of the asset classes listed in that infographic. If Bitcoin can replace a small fraction of the utility of cash, gold, equities, debt, or derivatives, it will have trillions of dollars in value. It just so happens that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies compete in all of these asset markets. Are they better than existing assets? For certain use cases, definitely. For all use cases? Probably not. Being useful in certain use cases is enough in a mature market to justify a value for Bitcoin many times what it is.


*Why Bitcoin's largest value is hodling*

I bought a gold coin with my bitcoin recently, and while holding the coin, I took another coin of local currency of almost the exact same size and compared the gold coin and the currency coin. It dawned on me that both were shiny metal, and to a child would be equivalent, but the gold coin represents over 4000x the value of the currency coin to the market.

If you reflect on this, you can see that a primary value of gold is that it is a compact and efficient way to store non-inflationary value. In this regard, Bitcoin is far more efficient. Bitcoin has no weight and is more difficult to lose or steal.

Gold justifies an $8T market cap, and most gold is hedled by governments in their reserves. These reserves store gold as opposed to tin or iron or oil because it is more efficient to store and transport gold than anything else physical. In this regard, if Bitcoin replaced even a fraction of world reserves, it would justify a few trillion dollars.

Furthermore, bitcoin is far more liquid than gold. If I would like to sell my gold coin right now, I will guarantee a loss because there is a spread of approximately 10%-20%.  This is because shipping and storage of physical gold costs money for traders. With bitcoin, the spread can be as little as 0.01%, which is an indicator of its high liquidity.

Experienced commodities traders may note that perhaps I should have bought a contract for gold settled in cash. I will get to that!

With potentially better properties for hodling than gold and cash-like liquidity, Bitcoin is more like a savings account than gold or cash. If Bitcoin is truly better than a normal savings account, which I believe it is, it is likely that Bitcoin and crypto can justify $20T-50T market caps. In a mature market many years away, that's 100-200x current values without much usage as a payment method or unit of account.

To sum it up, it is great that Bitcoin is useful in so many ways, but don't discount what Bitcoin is best at: saving! There is a lot of demand for savings accounts in the world.

I think it's really funny how many people in this reddit changed their mind about crypto in a short time. Prices are falling, people are losing money, not a good time I understand. But why are so many offending others in this reddit because they don't follow the mainstream? It seems like EVERYBODY knows prices will fall further. EVERYBODY is so smart to sell now (in some cases with losses) and EVERYBODY will buy back when prices are low enough. And if you don't do what EVERYBODY does you are not smart or stupid. The same people who follow the mainstream now asked this reddit months ago if buying BTC at 18k was not to late, and EVERYBODY said it will moon to 100k easily.

What I want to say is: don't follow everybody. Not everybody can get rich. Some smart people will take advantage of the whole crowd making the same decisions and I promise you, they will get rich and steal your money. Think for yourself, have your own opinion. 

Perhaps it is smarter to be against everybody sometimes even if you are attacked by them. "

the product was listed as ""Bitcoin Heineken T-Shirt""
i renamed it to ""Bitcoin Green Circle T-Shirt"" and replied them that i removed Heineken from product title and they replied today that i'm still under trademark infringement because the logo is a copy from heineken.

What should i do? Right now i removed the product because i don't want problems.

Among all the back-up methods, I find mnemonic seeds are most user-friendly for non-tech-savvy persons like me. Also, I really don't have to worry about changed addresses after every transaction. My question is that how come Bitcoin Core Wallet doesn't support 24 words seeds like electrum or some other wallets? I've read somewhere that you have to update wallet.dat file after every 100 transactions because of the changed addresses in Bitcoin Core (I may be wrong, I'm very non-tech-savvy and newbie in crypto).

Note:  I know hardware wallets are the most secured way to store. But I have very small amount and don't want to be bothered with Hardware Wallet at this moment. "

One easy way to do this without actually reducing your holdings is to keep a small amount of fiat, say $200, on an exchange. Then when you see a product or service you want that can be bought with Bitcoin, buy it with Bitcoin. You can then go to the exchange and buy back an equivalent amount of Bitcoin. I will be purchasing VPN service like this as soon as my fiat arrive at the exchange. "

8uv3z1,1530294346,MalcolmRoseGaming,0,6,Riot Blockchain: How This Bitcoin Company Might Strike It Rich,"Hey everybody! My name is Malcolm Rose and I like to write about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Lately I've taken an interest in the intersection between Bitcoin and the old-school trading world of the stock market. 

While many of us in the crypto-world tend to shrug our shoulders when told about Bitcoin companies and ETFs and so on, it's important to keep in mind that this is one very effective way to get people enthusiastic about cryptocurrency. Make no mistake: **this is very good for adoption**.

People who are comfortable with their trading platforms do not have to learn a new skill to take an interest - suddenly, an entire untouchable demographic is involved and engaged. Those of us who are crypto-veterans often find it easy to underestimate what an intimidating learning curve Bitcoin still has - this is, in fact, the main reason why I write my educational articles!

Previously I wrote about a dumpster-fire of a cryptocurrency company called Longfin. Since then I decided to get more positive and focus on a company that I think is doing things right. Riot Blockchain is an American company which is focused on both Bitcoin mining and various ""targeted investments"" in the crypto world, such as acquiring ownership interests in up-and-coming exchanges and the like.

So, long story short, I've written an article about this company. I'd love to get some feedback and hear from the community what you guys think. Without further ado, I give you:

Users create an account, verify their skills, and upload it to the Aworker blockchain database. Companies who are searching for employees put out open positions and list prerequisites for employment.


The difference between Aworker and other online competitors is that Aworker uses an AI to automatically match the best candidates for the job, which means that the recruiting company has less work to do on their end. Additionally, users on the network can recommend friends for certain job positions, and if their friend gets interviewed or hired, they can receive WORK tokens. These WORK tokens can be traded on exchanges or used on the Aworker network to gain perks.


    Reduces Cost Per Hire: By handling everything through the blockchain, HR departments don’t have to spend as much time and money looking for qualified applicants. Traditionally, they would have to pay lots of money for advertisements and outreach just to get in touch with skilled individuals.
    AI Matching: The Aworker AI automatically matches open job positions with the best-qualified candidates. This is helpful for both parties, as it cuts down on the amount of time that they spend searching, and gives them custom-tailored results.
    Earn Money For Recommendations: If you’re browsing through jobs on your Aworker account and see something that would be a perfect fit for your friend, you can recommend them to that company. Once the AI approves the match and passes it on to the business, they will have a chance at an interview. If your friend gets hired, you get paid.


What Issue Does it Solve?

Many western nations are experiencing an unprecedented labor shortage. It’s becoming harder and harder for companies to find qualified and skilled labor whether they’re searching for industrial employees or graduate-level skillset. With Aworkers AI-powered matching system, companies and potential recruits spend less time browsing their options, and more time looking at pre-approved matches.

8uxk6x,1530313813,very_452001,4,5,Bitcoin 2013-14 Historical Statistics Repeating itself?,"Hi,

Bitcoin had a 78% decrease from 2013 all time high from around $1200 to $250. All time high for 2013 was on Nov 30th. To get to $250 boring volatility it took 1 and a half years and a further 6 months wait to see some uptrend totalling 2 years to wait to catch the slow bull train from the 1st train station stop. In summary this bear market lasted 2 years.

The 2017 crazy bull market started from May 1st 2017 from $1300 all the way to $20000 in Dec 2017 that took 8 months. This is 1438% increase. If we do get another bull run like this passing 20k all time high then new ATH will be $288000 in Dec 2021 then a repeat 78% retracement of this $over a quarter million figure? Isn't this bad health for bitcoin?

So using these statistics is it best to buy bitcoin at $4400 by boarding the 1st train stop departure in June 2019?

I know I will get a reply saying bitcoin's popularity and exposure wasn't as big in 2013-14 compared to now however can someone give me reasons why history wont repeat itself?

I know I will get another reply saying bitcoin died many times in past and survived however everyone knows this latest crash from 20k so how can bitcoin survive from this well exposed crash high from the sky?

Has the 78% crash from 20000 to 4400 scared the average public away to invest in it?

What must bitcoin do to gain the confidence from public again apart from lightning network and store door front logos appearing everywhere? Will it be the upcoming another economic recession like in 2007/8? Will average public able to afford bitcoin in a economic recession? Also how we stop average public driving up prices by 1438% in the future as it's not healthy growth.

My final question is how can bitcoin have a steady slow healthy growth without 78%'s retracements in its future?"

But I made it with friends through a lump sum, my friends didn't have a wallet, so i told them to pay me back in cash, and I would send them their bitcoins after they create an account.

So what happened was last night I was watching when the dip happened and got really excited, and told a few friends (let's say two?) and we each put different amounts to add up to a total (let's say $110), how would I properly divide them up, since bitcoin fluctuates so wildly?

It's going to take a few days to process I'm assuming, and I have a ton of questions:

* how many satoshis do I even have?
* how do i calculate this?
* let's say my first friend X bought $20 worth, my 2nd friend Y bought $40 worth, and I bought $50 (Z). when I get the bitcoins in my bank account on top of what I already have, how do I 1) find out how much I had before my friends bitcoins arrived in my account and 2) calculate how much bitcoins they are owed? or would it be easier to just send them $10 worth of bitcoin? they bought it during the dip, so i'm wondering if it's possible to calculate whatever their share ($10 at the time of purchase) plus the growth (or loss) before i send it to them through the app.

tl;dr: friends and i pooled money together to buy during dip, how do i math"

Scenario B: a bitcoin is worth $17.21 in two years.

My question is about the ""blockchain wallet"" that signs the reward transactions. Could you provide more details about it? It's not clear to me. For example, I wonder if this blockchain wallet has its keypair public or private. By being private, only ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" would have the private key of the blockchain wallet used to sign the reward transactions. By being public, everyone could check out the private key.

This is an **obvious** marketing campaign being run against Bitcoin in various Crypto subs right now trying to keep the price down as long as possible.

I'm not offering any opinion on why this might be or who is responsible, but it clear that it **is** happening."

He told me that he belonged to a mining company and needs to sell 10+ BTC on a daily basis. He gave me a very good rate (\~10&amp;#37; less than the market price) plus a bonus if I dealt on a regular basis.  Then he told me that he can save escrow fees by using [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) wallet and insisted in trading using that system else he wont trade. Since, I hadn't used [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) wallet, I didn't know this feature existed there :/ He began explaining me how it works. Here it goes - First I'll have to create a wallet there. Then I would have to send him the wallet id and password. Then he'll send bitcoins to the wallet which is protected by an ""escrow key"". Thereafter, I can change the password of my [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) account to make sure he cannot open my wallet anymore. I smelled something very very fishy  still gave the man the benefit of doubt as I hadn't used [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) wallet and told him to show me a demo by doing a transaction of $1 worth bitcoins. He agreed and I gave him the credentials of a demo account. Then he told me to confirm an email authorizing login from an unknown browser. I did it as it was a demo account and a demo email id too. Soon he told me to login to my wallet and click on send. I could see a ""watch-only"" address with balance of 0.002 BTC and needed a private key to send funds from that wallet. He told me that I already had the bitcoins in my wallet and needed that private key or ""escrow key"" which he would tell after I had sent him money. I was astonished to how dumb this scam is. But realised that many don't know what a private key is and can easily fall to this scam. Always know that **""not your keys, not your funds"".**"

In a recent blog post at https://medium.com/@seweso/small-block-steel-man-f9109ac7ab Wouter Schut analyzed the BCT versus BCH debate. His analysis came across to me as being objective and thoughtful—things that seem rarely present in this debate.

Schut frames the article as a “steel man” toward the small block or Bitcoin Core argument. That is, he is attempting to explain why small blocks or Bitcoin Core is inferior by announcing their best-laid arguments. “Steelmanning,” apparently tries to argue against something by, oddly, outlining the other side’s most solid, but unstated, arguments. It is helping the weaker arguer by presenting his best evidence that he has failed to present on his own. Frankly, it is unclear to me how this aids one’s own argument, yet that is steelmanning.

For purposes here, though, I admire the civility that was involved in the post.

Wouter lays out seven contentions of small blockers. He purports that these tenets are fundamental to small blockers and Bitcoin Core. I can’t disagree. For sake of scoreboarding, let's take a look.

Extreme consensus. The idea is that if we’re to truly believe in decentralization, a simple majority-rule doesn’t cut it. After all, 50% plus one more person could mean domination over the minority. I like this, but also believe in free market principles and survival-of-the-fittest in the economy. Allowing BCH to spawn, compete, then either survive, dominate, or thrive is the way of the business world. Score +1 for BCH. BTC = 0, BCH = 1.

Centralization risk/cost of bigger blocks. This is a huge problem, in my mind, with BCH. The few and large mining operations, Jihan Wu and China, spit in the face of decentralization. +1 BTC. BTC =1, BCH = 1.

Bad UX and speed on-chain. BCH, no question, for now. This could certainly change though going forward with the Lightning network if it indeed grows in usage. BTC = 1, BCH = 2.

Most transactions are off-chain. This is an interesting idea…that “buying” bitcoin or any crypto on an exchange isn’t really buying it. It’s meting out a deal with the third-party exchange (that is, unless you’re using an exchange like EtherDelta). BTC = 2, BCH = 2.

Store-of-value is more important than MoE. I tend to disagree with the notion here that BTC-folk make this assumption. From the start, both were important. Frankly, this notion of HODLing is more new to the game. Anyone paying attention back in like 2013 will remember many-a-posts on reddit shaming anyone who held onto their BTC rather than using it. The mindset was that the only way to grow bitcoin’s usage and population was to put it to use. Also, bitcoin’s push toward Segwit and Lightning hint that there is a strong desire to make it a method-of-exchange (MoE) for everyday things as well. If the Lightning Network comes to fruition, that may happen. BTC = 3, BCH = 2.

Off-chain does better. Yes*. There is an asterisk here, though. Off-chain also begins to slide away from Satoshi’s original vision. It is less transparent, or not at all, depending on how it is done. As a for-instance, Visa or PayPal are fantastic tools. I use and like them both. But, I have to trust them. Still, off-chain certainly would mean faster and a better user experience overall. The proverbial cup of coffee is all it takes to see this. Paying in BTC on-chain would mean the TX fee is more expensive than the coffee, and/or, you hold up the line for 10 minutes to confirm. Off-chain does better. BTC = 4, BCH = 2.

SPV demands you trust miners. SPV is where a “light client” processes transactions but doesn’t have to download the whole whopping blockchain, just the applicable part. This one is tricky. I don’t think anyone disputes that these light SPV clients are accurate or not. But, as Schut points out in his article, it comes around to governance. Oddly for the BTC crowd, this also undercuts ""extreme consensus"", as Schut alludes. And, as always with money and crypto, it comes back to trust. The miners who run full nodes (they’ve downloaded the full blockchain) are the ones at the foundational level. Anyone running a light node is trusting those full nodes. Like a skyscraper, the 99th floor holds up the top floor, floor 100, but every single floor trusts the foundational level. Big blockers (BCH) would fall victim to non-SPV first, but I’ll call this one a tie because both will eventually crush under their own weight without scaling solutions.

Final score, BTC = 4; BCH = 2

Things change fast in crypto. But, to me the takeaway now is that BCT is either going to have to simply say, “Bitcoin is digital gold, that’s it.” Or, the Lightning Network, or something off-chain, will need to be fully implemented.

The first idea is quite convenient. You can just do nothing. For the first time ever, doing nothing has actually become a heroic deed – people are proud to be hodlers, proud to do nothing with their cryptocurrency. But do you really believe this approach will change the world? Seriously?   
   
Let’s be honest. Real crypto communities – there are few. There are few people who own cryptocurrency. The number is vanishingly small. Crypto prices will not grow while there are so few of us. The demand is just too small and there are no drivers of growth.   
   
So, what should we do? Is there a reason to just sit and wait for cryptocurrencies to grow? I believe there is none. The only possible solution is that people actually start using crypto in their everyday lives. The number of crypto transactions should amount to hundreds of millions a day. Then, and only then, will cryptocurrencies grow in price.   
   
Personally, I see no other options. However, this cannot be handled by one man alone. The whole crypto community should do this. You may ask: is it possible to live paying with cryptocurrencies only? Judging from our experience –  yes. Moreover, we have video proof: here is a story of a guy from Zurich [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb\_yVnkHSFs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb_yVnkHSFs) and here is a story of a guy from Thailand [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09U16Oqbck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09U16Oqbck).   
   
People will say I’m biased, since I founded a project where you can sell and buy goods for crypto. Yes, it’s true. Still, I’m more interested in expansion of cryptocurrencies than in my project’s expansion. In fact, I founded it for one simple reason: I’m sure that hodlers will never change the world. But we will. We should just learn from the guys in our videos who pay with cryptocurrencies in everyday life and make cryptocurrencies valuable.   "

As Neil deGrasse Tyson so eloquently quoted ""[Time is defined to make motion look simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPOR55M_P0)""; what he's saying here is that the only reason we have a ""need"" for the concept of ""Time"" is to allow us a unit of measurement to describe motion effectively...

There is evidence that Time is our most valuable resource when you look back in History: The first accountants were ""time-keepers"" ie. the first astronomers! They first used motion to delineate a unit of time by realizing the Sun that rises and falls, this is presumably the first unit of time ever invented. This smaller unit of measurement (day) was used to delineate and measure other movements of greater celestial objects and eventually it helped us figure out where we were in the galaxy! It is no coincidence the first accountants were accountants of time or ""time-keepers"", it is VALUABLE!  


[A drawing of early astronomers, accounting for \\""Time\\"" by using the motion of celestial bodies...](https://i.redd.it/wsztcwo697711.jpg)

They knew not what they were measuring, but they didn't need to know, they saw something repeat; thus a unit of time was created... If you have something that repeats predictably, you've created a time-keeping mechanism...  


One could argue that Time is the only resource we truly ""have"", but one could also successfully debate that ""Time"" itself is a tool to help us accomplish things more predictably, thus preserving a bit of Time... This is quite literally the only use we have for Time, it is primarily why we invented it back when our ancestors looked at stars...

https://i.redd.it/lk3osuzu97711.jpg

If something saves you time, it is money... The reason is because Time IS money... When you buy a pack of bubble gum, you are buying the time necessary to create that product. When you work, you get paid for your time. Time IS money... This is why when you give somebody money and then wait a few years, you should expect a return of some kind, you gave them the money PLUS the time, this is the entire reason why ANY interest EVER is paid on ANYTHING... TIME!  


The man who can waste somebody else's time is truly wicked, but that is a subject for a different post, let's get right to the Hero:  


Lightning Network  


Now that you know the importance of time, and therefore money, you should see the potential lying dormant in the Lightning Network...  


When BILLIONS of people around the world can transact near instantaneously, we will see a compound interest effect upon both the time AND money savings that are offered to ALL of Humanity...

We have planes that can cross the Atlantic Ocean faster than any form of Global Money; this is truly unacceptable for the 21st Century, Lightning Network will solve this problem, and it will do it quickly...  


HyperBitcoinization was never just about ""fast-money"", it was about ""fast-everything""...  


Buckle up butter-cup, the future is coming!
