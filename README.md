# BigDataClass
Welcome! This is the repository used for the semester assignment in "Collecting and Analyzing Big Data" at KU Leuven (Acadmeic Year 2020-2021). 

In the assignment, we wrote a short research paper in which we investigate the interrelation between the Bitcon price (BTC) and thread activity on the subreddit r/Bitcoin. In general, we wanted to investigate which impact the price of Bitcoin has on the thread activity, the texts put forward in the thread texts. The code put forward in this repository summarizes our work and analyses.

# Preliminary Methods Employed
During the course of this analysis, we employ several methods, both self-taught and taught during the class lectures. A few examples of those include:

- Topic Modeling
- (Un-)Supervised Learning
- Working with Data in different formats (CSV, JSON)
- Working with APIs
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
