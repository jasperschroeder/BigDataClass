# Preliminary Goal
Investigate the interrelation between bitcoin price movements and activity on the r/cryptocurrency forum. 

# Preliminary Research Questions
1) Do increases in prices / increases in volatility lead to increased activity on the forum? 
2) Is there a shift in topics observable over time and in relation to the Bitcoin price index? (Via topic modeling)
3) How does sentiment of comments (positive, neutral, negative) change over time? 
4) Do spikes in the Bitcoin price lead to more 'new users' being active in commenting? 


# Preliminary Methods Employed
- Topic Modeling
- (Un-)Supervised Learning
- Working with Data in different formats (CSV, JSON)
- Working with APIs
